i bought my son a new bicycle for his birthday. <eos> he spent the afternoon riding it up and down the road. <eos> he rode it pretty far into a wooded area. <eos> then he rode it out to the docks and stopped to watch the boats on the water. <eos> all that riding tired him out and he fell asleep on our car ride back home.
today we went for a long bike ride through the park. <eos> the boy led the way and i followed behind.  <eos> he was full of energy and couldn't stop exploring the park. <eos> he made it to the dock and decided that was a good place to end the journey. <eos> he must have tired himself out because he fell asleep as soon as we got in the car!
we took the boat out for a ride on the lake. <eos> we all piled on for a great conversation and had a few drinks. <eos> the captain of this ship is so young, just a baby really. <eos> we went by a cabin on the lake, maybe we'll rent that for our next vacation. <eos> every body had a great time and can't wait to do it again.

every year when we go to the fair, i always love seeing all the face painting.  <eos> the adults aren't afraid to look a little silly. <eos> and the kids like to go all-out by getting their whole face covered in paint. <eos> this year there was also a glass artist. <eos> and he wasn't afraid to be a little silly, too, because here he is with a clown.

we invited the family over for a crab boil. <eos> the kids sat around, useless as usual, as the adults did the work. <eos> my mother sat with the baby most of the time. <eos> the dog got antsy and started sniffing around for food. <eos> then we loaded the crabs in the pan and prepared them for cooking.

i've got a cottage on the lake that i like to go to for vacations. <eos> the lake is actually pretty big. <eos> we also have a boat out there. <eos> we usually build a campfire after the sun goes down. <eos> we build the fire in the compost pile because ashes are good for the garden.
the fire burned in an angry and nasty biblical way. <eos> the flames seemed to reached toward heaven. <eos> the sky was gray, dark with clouds gathered from the smoke of the fire. <eos> the fire as it appears to be loosing its power. <eos> fire, still destructive and cruel, but appearing contained.
we stayed by a lake. <eos> the lake was very calm. <eos> we decided to take a boat ride out. <eos> later that evening, we built a fire. <eos> we just sat and relaxed around it.
the lake house had a little dock for the boat. <eos> the water was very still that day. <eos> we went out on the jet skis. <eos> at night, we light a fire and hung out. <eos> the fire burnt great and we even cooked a bit on it.

the water was calm <eos> near the shore. <eos> the people laughed <eos> at the window <eos> and then they laid out.
i went on a nature hike with my dad and my brother. <eos> we eventually ran across this creek. <eos> there was a huge boulder right in the middle of the stream. <eos> my dad joked about diving off. <eos> i used the self timer and got a picture of us all together.
my dad and i went hiking last weekend. <eos> we went through some amazing valleys. <eos> the mountains had gorgeous rocks on them. <eos> there were hidden rivers all over the place. <eos> we met up with our friend before going home to eat.

a young boy watched his dad and grandpa work on a backyard project. <eos> after they finished their project, the family sat down to a meal. <eos> there was potatoes, beef, and rice. <eos> full from all of the food, they sat on the couch to look at family pictures. <eos> two members were so exhausted from the long day that they fell asleep in their chairs.

it was time for our picnic. <eos> grandpa did the grilling. <eos> the chicken was delcious. <eos> then we went for a dip in the pool. <eos> what an awesome day it was.
our fourth of july barbecue was the best. <eos> dad ruled over the grill like a master. <eos> there wasn't much food left at the end of the day. <eos> the kiddie pool was a perfect place to cool your feet on a hot summer day. <eos> someone had so much fun, they didn't want to go to bed after their shower.
we had a party to celebrate july 4th this weekend. <eos> grandpa was in charge of the grill. <eos> the food was great and most of it was gone real fast.  <eos> mom loved catching up with aunt sue. <eos> i love hanging out with my dad. 
the barbecue cookout was lots of fun. <eos> it was at a really popular fishing spot.  <eos> this truck had tons of advertisements on it. <eos> there was plenty of buns to go around. <eos> the corn barbecuing was the best part.
the stands for the ball game were packed. <eos> the mascots were ready to go. <eos> fans watched the scoreboard closely. <eos> it was a very close game. <eos> in the end, we won!
mascot meeting before the game. <eos> everyone picked the player they thought would do the best. <eos> the pitcher was voted the number one. <eos> he got ready to throw the ball. <eos> then stopped and changed his mind.
thousands of people went to the ball game. <eos> the show before the game was extremely entertaining. <eos> i was anxious for the game to start though. <eos> i had a lot of money riding on the final score. <eos> thankfully, my team won, and i did too!
this is the largest turn out this year for a baseball game. <eos> i just love the mascots uniforms. <eos> aunt sally is wondering when the game will start.  <eos> this game is going to be a close one. <eos> what is baseball with out the arguments?
yo yo yo. i got a story for you today. <eos> there was this zebra named zeeb. he was just minding his business when he bumped into his enemy, white bear.  <eos> white bear started at him and was like yo you got a problem? <eos> zeeb turned to him and was like, come at me bruh. zeeb looked super cool. <eos> white bear noticed his cool and walked away. i was like wow i need to get some of my own stripe.
mark is cleaning out his train. <eos> he then goes and sees his pet polar bear. <eos> after seeing his pet polar bear a brown bear comes up to him. <eos> then an owl comes from out of nowhere. <eos> a zebra comes too!
we went to the zoo today and got to see so many animals  <eos> my son feel in love when we got to see the zebras  <eos> i me myself i couldn't wait to see the polar bears jump in the water and swim  <eos> we ended up making a second pass around the zebras for my son  <eos> so while my son went to look at the zebras i went back to enjoy more of the polar bears 
a man was preparing the zoo for us. <eos> once everything was ready, we saw a polar bear. <eos> we also saw an oddly colored polar bear. <eos> we were scared, and seeing an owl did not calm us. <eos> we decided to leave but our path was blocked by a zebra.
we went to see the animal kingdom, and our first stop was some gazelle like animal <eos> eventually we came to see the zebra, who is very majestic in his pasture <eos> when we came to the polar bear, i couldn't help but see his moustache <eos> we went back to see the zebra again; he's my favorite animal. his mane is so cool <eos> when we left the park later on we passed the polar bear, who gave us a smile as we departed
my son was excited to go to this first baseball game with his daddy. <eos> the two of them had such a great time together at the stadium. <eos> the best part of the day for them both was our team winning by a few homeruns! <eos> after the game, he was able to go down on the field and play. <eos> he was tired by the end of the day, but it is a day he will remember forever.
i went to the ball game with my family last week. <eos> there were a lot of empty seats in the stands. <eos> my dad was sitting next to me the whole time. <eos> the game was very close. <eos> the players were very good but there was a lot of downtime in between innings.
my dad took me to the baseball game because i made good grades. <eos> here is me and my dad having a great time. <eos> the game was very close here everyone was cheering. <eos> my dad took me to the field to take some pictures it was awesome. <eos> overall we had a great day at the game, here is the last picture on the field before we left.
the stadium was packed with people on the day of the game. <eos> son and father alike, watched the players triumph over the other team. <eos> they went all day, vying for the win. <eos> after the game, they got to run down onto the field, and see the place through the player's eyes. <eos> they both had a great time, and were glad they came.
for father's day, this young man took his father to a red sox game. <eos> they shared snacks before the game. <eos> the game was fun and exciting. <eos> afterward, the fans were allowed to come down to the field and meet some of the players. <eos> and the young man caught an awesome souvenir. 
the cake before it is devoured by the family. <eos> lizzy wolfs down a piece of the delicious caek. <eos> grandpa fixes one of the toys that girls broke. <eos> the girls all ready to throw lizzy into the pool. <eos> the more mature crowd sit and catch up around the table.
i love growing flowers in my garden, but there are a few instant favorite varieties of mine. <eos> the white faded pink roses are some of the best in my collection of roses and they really blend in well with any color. <eos> in truth though, the hot pink ones are not just another favorite, but one that people notice the most. <eos> these beauties like to hide, but as my neighbor says, they hide because they are shy. <eos> at times nature creeps in even more and i get a few animal visitors. 
there are so many different flowers in my garden. <eos> i like the white ones especially. <eos> these are pink, and they are growing in great. <eos> look how large the bush of flowers has gotten. <eos> i even have some friendly animals hanging around.
the garden had a lot of beautiful flowers in it.  <eos> these pale pinks ones were one of my favorites. <eos> the property had many of these bushes. <eos> i wanted to cut some of these to bring inside. <eos> this little guy watched us while we viewed the gardens. 
i love taking pictures of flowers. <eos> when they are in a bunch they are beautiful. <eos> even flowers that stand alone are beautiful. <eos> the colors are amazing. <eos> even the individual petals make a great photograph.
we got the the race and were extremely excited! <eos> the racers all headed off to the trail to get started. <eos> for a long time the guy in blue was leading the pack. <eos> but i was catching up with him and i knew that i had the determination to win. <eos> in the end some guy that we didn't even know ended up beating us both somehow, i am guessing doping was involved somehow.
the cyclists rounded up, ready for the marathon. <eos> they breached the woods and headed for the trail. <eos> there were many types of terrain and jumps. <eos> the cyclists had to cross narrow bridges. <eos> they eventually exited the woods and stopped for a quick rest.
a group of people on bikes start to gather on a street for a ride. <eos> they ride over to the edge of the trees and wait for the ride in the woods to begin. <eos> they start their journey into the wood and begin their ride. <eos> this biker makes his way down the ramp onward into the woods. <eos> this person speeds over a bridge that hovers over a valley below.
the bikers gather for the race.  <eos> a team gathers in a field to discuss the route they will all take. <eos> the first biker sets off on the course on a path through a forest.  <eos> he overcomes obstacles as he comes across them. <eos> he speeds over the wooden bridge feeling it shake beneath him.
the bike club gathered i the town square. <eos> before the ride we all discussed the terrain ahead. <eos> this rider was quite adept at jumping over obstacles. <eos> one by one the riders jumped over the obstructions in the trail.  <eos> there was a cool little bridge over the ravine.
the umbrella catches the light. <eos> he's taking a picture of you taking a picture of him. <eos> they share some smiles together. <eos> he takes a moment to kiss the baby. <eos> he's getting ready to nurse that beer.
friends are gathered together having a few drinks. <eos> even the baby is enjoying some outdoor time as he takes his bottle in mom's lap. <eos> a couple of friends casually lounging in chairs. <eos> one guy tries out his hipster look for the camera. <eos> a woman sits alone at the table with a bottle of wine.
the midday sun shone orange yellow through the umbrella. <eos> a semi-drunk man took a picture with an old style camera. <eos> the family smiled; all except sad suzy, who contemplated her beverage. <eos> a father tells his son he's still too young to drink.  <eos> his brother, however, is old enough to indulge, and does. 
having a few friends over for a back to school party makes good memories.  <eos> sylvia and dan brought their handsome twin boys eric and john. <eos> this new lens cover makes ron and jeremy look like rock stars. <eos> the black and white lens makes dan look so sophisticated. <eos> a good time was had by all. leslie stayed to help me clean up and drink more beer.
these pictures are for an assignment for class.  <eos> i took them at our cookout trying to show how light factors into photos. <eos> as the evening rolled on you can see the same area in different lighting. <eos> i loved to soft glow it had as the sun was just about to set. <eos> and here is the same shot without the baby, but in black and white. hope i get an a!
we came out to celebrate our uncle's 1 year sobriety this afternoon. <eos> the restaurant had some gorgeous decorations. <eos> many of us had not seen each other since the intervention and caught up that day. <eos> his wife was so proud of him for reaching the achievement. <eos> then we huddled together to capture this moment that changed his life.

the bus has taken them to where they needed to go. <eos> some beautiful white flowers are seen. <eos> they then discovered some pink flowers. <eos> the water sits at the base of the town. <eos> the cathedral's interior is desolate yet filled with beauty.
we went across the river to the old city. <eos> there are many homes along the coastline.  <eos> we traveled through town. <eos> the magnificent church was stunning.  <eos> the craftsmanship on the inside was fantastic. 
our bus arrived at our stop.  <eos> we snapped a few pictures of flowers.  <eos> these were very pretty.  <eos> we walked the trail to the water. <eos> we entered an old building.
we took a tour bus to tour the city on vacation.  <eos> we got to go through the botanical gardens and see some great flowers.  <eos> this cherry blossom tree was beautiful.  <eos> we got to go along the river and see the entire city.  <eos> then we got to go to a old cathedral at the end of the day and see inside of it. 
we took a bus out to the country side.  <eos> there was some incredible flowers in the fields out there.  <eos> as well as some great red flowers.  <eos> we saw a great view of the seas side town.  <eos> and took a look inside the cathedral that was nearby. 
welcome to finger painting day, i'm emmy and i'm 3. <eos> i am a little wild and out of control but i do love my finger paints. <eos> here is where i get paint all over my hands and i shouldn't touch my face! <eos> i made this for my mom and my dad. they will love this. <eos> here is one that my friend made for me. i love it.
the kids had a blast on their first day in daycare. <eos> their first activity was to paint their foot and hand prints on a large piece of paper. <eos> everyone watched on as the kids dipped their toes in paint. <eos> the care workers helped the younger kids get paint on their feet. <eos> the end result was a masterpiece.
our little girl is in love with hand painting. <eos> here she is going crazy while painting, she gets in the wildest poses. <eos> she loves getting messy and never fights it. <eos> she made this drawing for her father and mother. <eos> and this one for her friend, shes so adorable.
teaching the next generation to be growing artists is an important job. <eos> that doesn't mean it isn't a fun one though. <eos> today we're working on hand painting. <eos> that literally means using hands to apply the paint. <eos> they always find that a lot of fun, and it makes marvelous art for their homes.
jessie was in class that morning.  <eos> the teacher wanted everyone to try hand panting.  <eos> she panted her hands green first.  <eos> and made a large board with the palm of her hand.  <eos> the board was for her best friend. 
"my fortune cookie says: ""you will meet a strange dark haired lady...in bed."" i added that last part.  <eos> i glanced across the room. there was a strange dark-haired lady sitting at a table, alone.  <eos> we talked. we liked. i invited her to meet my family. they liked her, too! <eos> my mother was especially pleased. she was very happy. so was my father and my brothers.  <eos> "except for larry. larry bet me fifty dollars that it wouldn't last. he repeated that bet each year. happy anniversary, larry! this year's meal is on you!
going on a lovely date with this beautiful lady. <eos> here we are at b&t steaks and seafood. gonna be great!!! <eos> here we are, my friend came along for support with his date. <eos> here is my food, looks oh so good. <eos> here is hers and it also looks good. i wanna ask her if she'll share.
it was our first dinner with our families. <eos> it was a chance for them to meet before my fiance and me got married. <eos> it was a bit nerve wracking, but we held in there. <eos> her mom an dad were actually pretty cool people. <eos> overall i think it went pretty well.
our family went to dinner that evening.  <eos> sarah really liked the food.  <eos> everyone had lively conversation.  <eos> and we saw friends we hadn't seen in a while.  <eos> everyone was satisfied at the end. 
every month, the family likes to get together for a large meal.  <eos> this month, they decided to go to a steak, seaford and wine bar.  <eos> they talked about work and school.  <eos> the parents love hearing about how their children are doing.  <eos> they were especially excited to learn that three of their sons were planning a new startup company.
we all waited anxiously for the parade to start. <eos> the vfw led it off with the flags. <eos> then came our high school marching band. <eos> the color guard did and awesome job. <eos> the grand marshal finished the parade up in a beautiful classic car.
onlookers gathered on the sides of the street for the parade. <eos> the flag corps led the parade down the streets. <eos> then the local marching band entertained us. <eos> the flag twirlers came out, but had some problems staying in sync. <eos> the mayor closed up the parade, waving at the crowd as he passed. 
we all sat down and watched the parade. <eos> the color guard waked by. <eos> the marching band walked by. <eos> the flags waved too. <eos> then a classic car came by.
it's parade day, and the whole town turns out to watch. <eos> there are those who serve our country, and the crowds cheer. <eos> there are the bands, and the music is loud but thankfully well performed. <eos> the flags are always fun to watch. <eos> and of course you get the old cars and their owners traveling through.
we all went to the parade. <eos> they had a cool marching group to start.  <eos> then came the school marching band.  <eos> they had some women spinning batons afterwards <eos> and a car with some of the local businesses near the end. 
taking a trip with the kids is fun.  <eos> loading everything up for the trip is not.  <eos> but luckily there is a lot of room in the minivan.  <eos> and the kids are pretty well behaved on long trips.  <eos> so the open road isn't that bad at all. 
we packed for the trip that we were taking.  <eos> we had to take the car for a long period of time.  <eos> we saw a low rider truck along the way.  <eos> we boarded our plan and flew to our final destination.  <eos> we spent a few nights at the hotel. 
everybody's packed for the trip. <eos> kids are in the car and ready to go. <eos> we dropped the rental off and finn got a picture next to the car. <eos> mike asked us if this was our plane. <eos> we spent the night in the hotel after a long day of travel.
the family packed their luggage to take a vacation. <eos> dad was driving and everyone was loaded in the car ready to go. <eos> they stopped to check out a truck for sale and their son took a photo by it. <eos> off to the vacation they go as they fly away on a 747 airplane. <eos> now it is time to sleep. everyone is in the bed and ready to call it a night.
the kids got up early for our road trip . <eos> everyone's suitcases and bags are packed up and ready to go. <eos> the suitcases have been loaded into the car. <eos> selfie from the driver's seat. this might be dangerous if i was actually driving, but thankfully i'm not! <eos> the country road is beautiful. 62 miles to go!
i went hiking with my boyfriend today in the national park. <eos> we crossed a bridge while we were walking through. <eos> the bridge passed over this breathtaking river. <eos> we reached a cave and took a couple photos there. <eos> the national park is truly beautiful and i can't wait to come again.
today we finally arrived to our california destination. <eos> brock wanted a serious photo of himself sitting next to the redwood sign. <eos> the scenery here was absolutely breathtaking with the mountains and the beautiful trees. <eos> stumbled upon a solar toilet, craziest thing i've seen lately! <eos> the best part of the day was standing next to these big beautiful trees, nothing like nature to put everything into perspective.
she poses at the california state line. <eos> he's happy to be in the redwood forest. <eos> they pose together at the vista. <eos> the solar toilet is explained in the diagram. <eos> the trees make them look like little insects.
becca and bob posed for a picture before their hike. <eos> we hiked over this bridge. it felt a little unstable. <eos> the water was really roaring fast. the water was really cold. <eos> the rocks were neat to look at. we wanted to see it all. <eos> at the end of the day we were at the top. the view was just beautiful.
we went for a hike in northern california. <eos> we crossed through the redwood national park.  <eos> we climbed up some small mountains. <eos> and laughed at the novelty of the solar toilet. <eos> we found a really large redwood tree. 
mack went on an expedition recently to the mountains of colorado. <eos> mack's friend donnie went with him on the expedition. <eos> they came across an enormous waterfall that took their breath away. <eos> while walking a trail they could see a vast mountain in the background. <eos> after the expedition was over mack was ready to get home and rest up and reflect on his experience.
the couple went on vacation. <eos> he dressed for the outdoors. <eos> they did a lot of exploring. <eos> they had to be careful when walking on the rough terrain. <eos> they really subscribed to the philosophy on this truck: one life-live it.
today is the day of the big hike. <eos> everyone came out to do this journey together. <eos> the waterfall is beautiful. <eos> the guy has definitely accomplish his mission. <eos> it is now time to go home.
this man is going hiking. <eos> the trail goes through many different types of natural landmarks. <eos> this waterfall is 15 miles from where the party started the hike.  <eos> these rock walls line the trail. <eos> dan and dave loved going on nature hikes.
a view of our bed and breakfast from the hillside. <eos> tom hiking up the trail and posing for a picture. <eos> a long line of folks ahead of us trying to make it to the top. <eos> this is our group heading back down after making the summit. <eos> back at the truck and heading in for some food.
this is what all men want during a bit of relaxation for father's day.  <eos> this is the very reason why my husband wanted to come here for dinner.  <eos> i thought it was very nice of the waitress to write this on the blackboard at above our table.  <eos> i was waiting to see what the menu specials are.  <eos> happy father's day to all the awesome dad's out there.
almost every dad likes beer.  <eos> fathers day is a great day for dads.  <eos> there was free beer for dad!  <eos> the pub took reservations early.  <eos> lots of people took their fathers out for free beer. 
it was father's day. <eos> there is nothing my dad likes more than food and beer. <eos> so i search for the best deal i could find to get him what he wanted. <eos>  we ended up at a small bar that was running a great food special. <eos> we set and talked and drink beer together, it was a great time.
i ten bars at a local pub. <eos> today being father's day, we tried to come up with some sign ideas that would attract customers. <eos> first we tried one that touted a specific beer, but we figured that might not catch the attention of everyone.  <eos> so we tried a more straightforward approach, but that seemed too straightforward! <eos> so we tried the first choice, but with some fluff. it turned out okay.
the alcohol looked very good <eos> and a board was saying it is free <eos> for father's day. <eos> the deals were good <eos> to honor all the father's on that day.
it was a beautiful day out on the lake.  <eos> todd decided to take his boat out.  <eos> todd brought along a couple of his frat buddies. <eos> stew wanted to go tubing.  <eos> then larry wanted to wake board. 
he loved his boat and spending time on the water.  <eos> no one had loaded the ski's so they had to settle for the tube.  <eos> he gave each of them a turn on the tube.  <eos> when it was his best friends turn, he pulled him over the wake on purpose.  <eos> the water was the perfect temperature and the sky was clear and blue. 
it was a beautiful day at the lake. <eos> my dad took us out on his boat. <eos> we enjoyed relaxing while he got the tube ready. <eos> once he had it attached, my brother got on and my dad took off. <eos> i decided to water ski instead of using the tube.
in the summer time, dad likes to take big bobby out on the lake for some tubing behind the boat. <eos> big bobby weighs 250 pounds so he really needs to punch the throttle for maximum power. <eos> wow, big bobby broke the ski rope. that kid is so strong! <eos> yeah, we got the right speed. big bobby is hydroplaning perfectly, he's barely touching the water at this speed. <eos> we have so much fun tubing on the lake. i can't wait until next weekend.
he couldn't wait to get out on the lake with his family.  <eos> the kids loved tubing behind the boats.  <eos> they took turns riding on the tube.  <eos> one last ride on the tube before going home.  <eos> everyone loved the day on the lake. 
the family went bowling last night/ <eos> mom went up first and scored a ton of points. <eos> dad followed but he kept getting gutter balls all night long. <eos> we snacked on pizza and drank lots of soda. <eos> by the end of the night i was ready to go home and sleep forever 
grandma is a fantastic bowler. <eos> uncle joe isn't so he would rather take a snack break. <eos> the decorations in the bowling alley are just weird. <eos> i never know which ball to pick when i bowl. <eos> grandma keeps her lucky ball in this bag. she always wins
today grammy tonya took us bowling. we were all getting ready to battle.  <eos> grammy went first. she got a strike!  <eos> uncle tom dropped his ball. it was pretty funny.  <eos> next up was jack but he was taking his turn eating not playing. everyone was screaming at him.  <eos> my brother jerrod took jack's turn and knocked down 2 pins. he's the worst at this game. 
bowling. now this is a way to spend an evening. <eos> pizza and bowling is double well the way to spend the evening. <eos> and who can forget bowling with a big lebowski reference? this may be the best bowling ever. <eos> i always did tell my wife i had a lot of balls. <eos> unfortuantely, she took them from me and put them in that sack.
they went bowling that evening.  <eos> aunt marie was very good. <eos> uncle tom was the worst.  <eos> we ate pizza at the end of the night.  <eos> and talked with a hippy. 
today we visited the buffalo trace kentucky straight bourbon whiskey plant in lexington kentucky. this is a picture of the back side where we parked and then had to walk around to the front. <eos> pretty cool all iron buffalo outside the plant. that has to weigh a ton! <eos> this is one of the barrels that they age the whiskey in. this barrel was in the lobby as they don't allow pictures inside the plant or allow cameras to record how the exact process works. <eos> here is the lobby after our tour of the plant where samples are tested by workers and where we got to try a shot ourselves. <eos> here's the final product which is also for sale at a really nice price of only $10 a bottle. i bought the maximum allowed of five bottles and they gave us a nice box and a cart to wheel it back to the car. great day although i am feeling a bit tipsy off just one shot!
we decide to take a tour of this famous whiskey factory over the weekend. <eos> the barrels smelled of aged oak. <eos> we got to see the testing facility to ensure quality control. what a fun job that must be.  <eos> here's were the magic happens. the aging process in the barrels was a site to see. <eos> finally, the finished product. it was an enjoyable experience. 
this is my place of employment. <eos> it's awesome enough that it has a buffalo statue out front. <eos> also, we make whiskey.  <eos> i make whiskey, specifically. that's me in back there. <eos> free bottles for everyone!
a group of shipping containers sits in the parking lot of the factory. <eos> the barrel displays the name of the factory. <eos> two people are seen working on a factory line. <eos> the barrels line the walls of this dark space. <eos> bottles of whiskey are on full display.
we went whiskey tasting in kentucky.  <eos> the buffalo trace brewery was the best place to be.  <eos> we saw how they made beer as well.  <eos> and saw all the caskets in the basement.  <eos> we bought a bunch of bottles of whiskey to take home in the end. 
i went to see a play about relationships. <eos> one of the characters was getting drunk while talking about her husband. <eos> another character was getting drunk aswell. <eos> in another scene the men were sitting down complaing about women. <eos> in the last scene one of the husbands approached the wives.
she had a quick drink before the show. <eos> she was on set waiting for the host. <eos> the second guest was still getting her hair done. <eos> she had already had a few drinks. <eos> her hair was being curled.
we sat back before the interview started. <eos> we got our hair done. <eos> we had chips to snack on.  <eos> we started our skit. <eos> it was great.
"the play i was in last night was fabulous. this is mandy, erica and i talking on stage.  <eos> i was so styling my curlers. ""don't look at me i'm hideous!"" i cried my lines.  <eos> my pal erica was so good. she screamed and flung herself all over.  <eos> the guys, randy and matt were okay. i would have chose different but they were perfect assholes as they should have been.  <eos> """"no way! we don't eat meat here!"" we turned up our noses. the wiener monologues were so much fun!"
girl where did you get those flowers from? sitting up here all pretty like with that glow. <eos> i'm not impressed, just pass me my bucket of booze, she can keep the flowers. <eos> you're not impressed? girl, i'm not impressed with your alcoholic ways, but you don't see me blurting it out, do you? <eos> look at them girls over there arguing like fools. why can't they get along like us, man? im going to go over there. <eos> ladies, what's the issue? why can't you guys just get along and enjoy this beautiful trip?
everyone piled into the driveway for some summer fun.  <eos> the little dog was there to greet people as they came in. <eos> the little boy was excited for all the new faces.  <eos> they had fun swimming in the pool in the backyard. <eos> they also took a hike and captured some of the local scenery. it was quite a fun day. 
we arrived at nana's house around noon. <eos> the dog was the first one to greet us at the door. <eos> the kids went into to play in the murky dirty pool. <eos> one of them got sick and we had to run to the car and take them to the hospital. <eos> the problem was that we were in the middle of nowhere and had to drive to the next town.
many cars parked in our driveway. <eos> the dog was excited. <eos> the kids played in the pool. <eos> we had to move some of the cars. <eos> the scenery was gorgeous.
i had to drive on the ferry to get home today. it was so crowded.  <eos> my dog max was so happy to see me! i was home from a 5 day work week in the city.  <eos> hi tim! he greeted me at the door with cookies. i was so happy.  <eos> later on i went out and laid with the family in the brown water pool. it was so relaxing. i needed that.  <eos> then we took a leisure walk through the pasture. 
the cars are filling up the driveway as family arrives. <eos> the small dog is curious to the new visitors. <eos> the kids get in the pool and cool off from the heat. <eos> grandpa is walking around. <eos> the field is beautiful and lush.
today we race! line up and go!  <eos> my friend bill showed up! he's so determined. go bill!!  <eos> i took a break along the side for a minute and snapped a race photo. it was so much fun.  <eos> here comes tom and baby ann. can't talk now tom and anna! i have to race.  <eos> i ran fast and came up to the finish line! this 1k race was killer! yay i'm done!
the whole town came out fir the annual race.  <eos> and they're off! <eos> everyone loved the man's chair. it was very inspirational. <eos> even the young ones got to experience the excitement.  <eos> there's the finish line! what a race!
the city marathon is a huge family friendly event. <eos> anyone is allowed to run, whether its professional or simply for fun. <eos> some dedicated athletes participate in the marathon to demonstrate commitment. <eos> others run the marathon as a fun way of bonding with their children. <eos> whatever the reason, the meaning of the marathon isn't to finish first only to participate.
today there was a race. there were many workers there helping direct people to where they needed to be. <eos> there were all types of runners, even those that could not physically run due to not having legs were participating.  <eos> the crowd was a very large one and everyone was moving to see who would be first. <eos> even some parents, including dads came out to push their little ones in the stroller during the race. <eos> there was a lady that won first place, and when she crossed the finish line there were no other runners in sight!
the community had a walk-a-thon going on today an a lot of people turned out. <eos> even the handicap showed up to support the community. <eos> the crowed was large and the event was a huge success. <eos> parents even brought their children in strollers to support the community. <eos> and at the end of the race they were all winners one way or another.
we watched as the local handy man cleaned the train's platform. <eos> then voila! the family got their first glimpse of the historical steam train. <eos> we later had dinner in the local station that had been converted into a restaurant. <eos> the next day the kids were even more excited to participate in their own train building project. <eos> the fruits of their labor were enjoyed by all as they got to ride their own train for the first time.
today i took the children to wood working. <eos> the project is to build a giant train. <eos> each child contributed to building the train <eos> when it was complete the all the trains were connected together. <eos> the train was pulled along with all the children in tow.
the boys enjoyed working together and took turns making sure they could sit in the box. <eos> he thought his sister using a power tool was hilarious and they both got a severe case of the giggles. <eos> he wants the cart to be perfect and has studied the instructions many times over. <eos> hooking the carts together was not an easy task and required many helping hands. <eos> the project was worth all the hard work! even grown-ups wished they could have a turn.
let put together a train  <eos> make sure to wear your goggles when you are using tools  <eos> let's make this train personal  <eos> putting the finishing  <eos> all aboard the fun train
the kids banded together to make a train out of wood. <eos> everyone used proper safety precautions. <eos> the kids were allowed to decorate the inside's of their cars. <eos> this made for a great father/son activity. <eos> when it was all done, the kids got to ride the train. choo choo! 
taking pictures at dawn provide excellent results. <eos> the lakes in alaska are so beautiful. <eos> i get different shots on my camera with different tones, to really appreciate the beauty here. <eos> even the towns make for amazing pictures. <eos> cannot call it a day without one more picture of the snow covered mountains!
an aspiring photographer went on a trip to the mountains to test out a new camera. <eos> he came across many different types of scenery, including a beautiful lake. <eos> he tried out different camera modes, including black and white photography. <eos> on the journey, he came across an interesting building. <eos> he felt it refreshing to walk on the trails alone and capture moments in photography. 
the climber couldn't believe his luck as he reached the first crest and was met with a dark blue sky contracted against white clouds. <eos> oh one side of him was a crystal clear lake. <eos> on another a small farm just waking up. <eos> on his way back down the cliff side he could see his village off in the distance. he was ready to be home. <eos> he then said goodbye to the mountain. a least for now.
i took a ride on an airplane the other day. <eos> we flew over the mountains. <eos> i took some black-and-white pictures. <eos> this is close to where we landed. <eos> this is the prettiest picture i took.
the clouds and deep blue sky compliment the mountain peak. <eos> they find a lovely forested mountain with a lake. <eos> the misty clouds roll in and obscure the scene. <eos> in the distance the height of the mountains can be seen by the amount of dense snow covering them. <eos> on the road again moving towards another place.
we took a trip to a historical dental museum. <eos> inside was a room set up to look like an old dentist office. it even had a statue of a person working at a table. <eos> on one of the desks we saw a very old dental reference book used by some of the first dentists. <eos> there was also a box full of some of the first dental tools that were ever used. <eos> one of the last things we saw at the museum was box full of old dentures.
this is the historical dental museum. <eos> on the inside you can see many things, like the look of an old office. <eos> they also showcase old displays of teeth and medical gear. <eos> they actually have boxes full of teeth! <eos> they even show an old skull that looks like it had something wrong with it.
we went to the historical dental museum for school yesterday. <eos> it was a neat museum with everything having to do with teeth. <eos> they had rows and charts of books on teeth. <eos> they even had some of the instruments that dentists used to use on display. ughhh! <eos> at the end, we saw some of the dentures that the dentists had made.
it took about 20 minutes to arrive at the historical dental museum. <eos> first we saw what a dentist's office use to look like. <eos> and we saw one of the first books on dental hygiene.  <eos> the museum even showcased some of the first dental tools used.  <eos> there were even a box of old dentures that revealed how much things have changed in this industry.
going to the dentistry museum was one of the creepiness things i have ever done.  <eos> it started out okay, with a set up showing an old vintage dentist office.  <eos> but things got weirder and more unnerving as we went along.  <eos> the cigar box full of antique dentures was almost more than i could handle.  <eos> but the human skull that showed how they worked on the teeth...that was too much and i found an exit. 
packing up for the trip. <eos> i made sure everything was there. <eos> the bags were packed tightly. <eos> the black carry on had everything i could need. <eos> zipped it up and ready to go.
the first day of school is arriving soon, so i placed an order for school supplies. <eos> i purchased a messengers bag.  <eos> as well as a ton of necessary supplies. <eos> i started organizing them right away. <eos> i am very prepared for the first day of classes now. 
i packed my things for work today <eos> i also made sure to pack lunch. <eos> i brought my laptop with me. <eos> never know when you might need it. <eos> i put it in the bag.
i received a package with a diaper bag inside. <eos> i unraveled the bag and saw that the outside is gray and black. <eos> i opened the flap and saw there was a pocket and zipper. <eos> i unzipped the pocket and to my surprise the inside was pea green! <eos> i opened up the pea green portion and saw there is so much space in this bag.
the box was opened, and kurt waited for the right moment to escape his prison. <eos> he fell sideways as the bag was flipped around. any minute now, he would be able to get out. <eos> the bag was flipped again, and kurt was flung into the stiff fabric of his prison. <eos> the flap ripped open, and kurt braced himself. the moment fresh air struck his face, he scrambled out and ran. <eos> the owner of the bag peered inside, never knowing that a tiny man was now in his house.
it was another day at the graveyard.  <eos> there were fresh flowers at man of the graves.  <eos> peter was a great man.  <eos> i heard that bert was loved by his children.  <eos> i miss columbus. 
the graveyard made him a little uneasy, but he edged forward, camera ready. <eos> as he stood in front of a stone, he remembered a story someone had told him about this place. <eos> the person had said that many people saw ghosts out here. he peered at the next stone. he couldn't even read it. <eos> this one was clearer. he shivered. some of the people here had died so long ago. he could really imagine the owner of this stone as a ghost. <eos> he felt less jumpy when he saw the next gravestone. it was clean and the words were crisp. the man had died in 1997 and that didn't seem so scary.
we went to the gravesite. <eos> the walk was peaceful and serene. <eos> here's the first gravestone we found. <eos> this gravestone seemed to be carved by hand. <eos> this was the nicest looking grave we found.
this is an old cemetery in london.  <eos> a lot of war veterans are buried here.  <eos> some headstones are no longer readable.  <eos> peter was the last of his family to pass away that was born in the 1800's.  <eos> this was his army buddy columbus. 
we traveled somewhere we haven't been before. <eos> we arrived at our destination. <eos> peter c. curren rests here. <eos> another curren member rested here. <eos> lastly, a military man's grave was here.
my sister and i were fighting one day.  <eos> my mom said we had to kiss and make up, gross. <eos> she settled for a hug instead. whew.  <eos> then we sang a song.  <eos> now what mom? 
first day of school for my two. <eos> sis leans on big bro for a confidence boost. <eos> it doesn't take long to get wacky though. <eos> are you two ready for school yet. <eos> yay here come the bus.
today is the first day of training camp for toni and ember. <eos> they pose in sweet poses for the camera so mom can remember them this way. <eos> they also make fun faces as well, trying to enjoy their innocence while they can. <eos> it is hard for them to smile as they wave goodbye. <eos> they are excited to start their training to become extreme gymnasts though.
the bother and sister were ready for the first day of school. <eos> they were excited to go to their first day and meet new friends. <eos> they told their mom how happy they were. <eos> they said they were going to make a lot of new friends. <eos> then they got up and got ready to get in the car.
the brother did not want to talk to his sister. <eos> the siblings made up. <eos> they started to talk and smile. <eos> their parents showed up. <eos> they were happy to see them.
the day began with a modicum of excitement. <eos> mother walked the kids to school on the rainy day. <eos> the children and parents funneled into the school. <eos> as the children went into class, mother and daughter said goodbye and took a final photo. <eos> after that, it was time to do it all again with little roe!
my sister caught me eating her cookies. <eos> now we all have cookies.  <eos> dont tell mom, she is oblivious.  <eos> don't tell that kid in the orange either, he dresses funny and we dont like him. <eos> down with orange shirts!! 
she doesn't want to share her candy with her little brother before she goes to school. <eos> sally walking dora to school in the rain.  <eos> all the kids showing up for school. hope it stops raining so the kids can go outside today. <eos> dora didn't want another picture, but she's just so cute. <eos> he's waiting for dora to get home from school. he always misses her.

lenna got ready for her first day of school. <eos> i walked with her to the school. <eos> we joined a lot of students at the entryway. <eos> lenna looked kind of scared. she enjoyed herself that day though! <eos> next i dropped roe off for his first day of preschool. i was sad to see my baby go.
as i walked through the florist shop i noticed these exotic flowers. <eos> these flowers had a very sweet smell that might have been used in perfume. <eos> i grabbed an empty wine bottle and filled with water. <eos> i used some string to tie the stems together for a nicer arrangement. <eos> stepping back from the makeshift vase, i realize that i have a beautiful center piece.
the drought had gripped the entire nation. <eos> once fertile fields were bare. <eos> quickly made head stones dominated the landscape. <eos> cemeteries seemed to spring up everywhere. <eos> death came closely after drought.
i found some pretty flowers in the yard. <eos> purple is my favorite color so i cut them.  <eos> i thought they looked pretty in this vase. <eos> it looks good sitting on the deck. <eos> when i go in tonight i will take it and put it on my bedside table.
special report:a new breed of flower has been discovered! <eos> scientists wonder about the strange purple dots. <eos> but then it was discovered that the flowers were planted in whine. <eos> reports find that it was grown by a drunk gardener. <eos> we did not receive any comment from him.
these flowers are so pretty that they must be kept in a vase! <eos> this close up shows just how wonderful these flowers are! <eos> the beauty and elegance found in nature is astounding! <eos> even a bottle can make a good vase! <eos> the more these flowers grow, the more beautiful they become!

there was a blonde in front of me who understood the course. <eos> for the great effort, this redhead received a kiss. <eos> it was a lovely night and things were accomplished. <eos> the women had very lovely hairstyles. <eos> the coolest part about the event was the hair colors.
i went with some friends to go see a play. <eos> it was a really lovely show with a lot of love in it. <eos> the acting was superb, and the lead actor was a hunk! <eos> i was drawn in by the story; i totally recommend it. <eos> the cast all had matching nail polish. it was so cute.

celebrating independence day with some friends. what a night! <eos> we had some amazing fireworks going off and they were huge. <eos> this one looked like a spider on its web. so beautiful. <eos> the next day we saw this these trumpets blaring, it was quite a show. <eos> the city looks so boring with no more fireworks. maybe next year!
we love fireworks shows. <eos> we attend them every year. <eos> we attend mostly on new years and the 4th of july.  <eos> it's always fun when another fireworks show comes to town. <eos> it's a great time to spend with family.
the whole family was together for the 4th of july fireworks. <eos> they were quite beautiful. <eos> some looked like falling stars. <eos> earlier that day they had gone to a military funeral. <eos> the fireworks made them totally forget the sad event.
last night we joined some friends for a 4th of july celebration. <eos> there were big fireworks. <eos> and small fireworks. <eos> people played instruments while remembering the fallen. <eos> it was a beautiful 4th of july by the river.
we're celebrating independence day! <eos> we were able to see some great fireworks! <eos> this one looks like a dandelion floating in the wind. <eos> earlier we saw a band practicing for the parade. <eos> this is the purple people bridge. this is where they launched the fireworks.
children sit diligently in the classroom. <eos> the teddy bear lays alone on the chair. <eos> a boy holds up his red beanie baby. <eos> the girl in the stripes holds up her pink mouse. <eos> the little girl holds up her taupe bear.

before anything would happen on this valentine's day, we had to work on our assignments. <eos> most of us had their bears and stuffed pets nearby and couldn't wait to eschange them. <eos> he is going to be very popular with the girls with his pink and red teddy bear. <eos> this was my favorite one since it was the only baby kangaroo pet. <eos> the look on her face meant she appreciated the teddy bear she received as much as the boy that gave it to her.
the protest was well under way. <eos> and many people brought out signs to protest. <eos> people were wearing their home flags. <eos> many women also came out to protest. <eos> there was a speaker with a microphone who talked to the protesters.
the group is gathering for a protest. <eos> there are lots of different people representing a lot of countries. <eos> everyone decides to bring a flag to represent where they are from. <eos> they get to take turns telling their points of view. <eos> not everyone agrees with everyone else though.
protests are happening in tunisia. <eos> people are upset over terrorist attacks in their country. <eos> proud people hold the country's flag in solidarity. <eos> everyone is coming together to demand peace. <eos> one of the protest leaders talks to the crowd and demands change.
this lady is one of the faces of the palestinian demonstration. <eos> the voices of the crowd are loud and the symbols are vivid. <eos> this protester displays the palestinian flag. <eos> the raised fist is indicative of the intensity of the feelings being expressed. <eos> the woman continues the demonstration but the situation doesn't change
there was a rally today considering all of the iranian areas. <eos> they wished for more independance regarding communism.  <eos> however the other side wasn't willing to help them with their problem. <eos> the protesters began to get angry and make motivational speeches. <eos> the crowd was unmoved however, the protest still continues to this day
need to have a snack before setting out to explore. <eos> what people go on vacation for, to buy buy buy. <eos> getting a little silly with the lime but it's been a long day. <eos> one last picture of my day eating and shopping. <eos> what a funny monkey in his sunglasses, what some tourist won't do.
i put my new camera to the test as soon as possible. <eos> such vivid colors, i'm already thrilled with this camera. <eos> my sister is so photogenic no matter what camera is used. <eos> just a silly shot of a cool monkey. i love the blurring of the background. <eos> i need to learn the settings in lowlight, time to read the instructions!
for lunch we had chips and dip. <eos> then went to work on some art. <eos> she thought she was funny and tried to make me laugh by sticking a lime peel in her mouth. <eos> i posed for some pictures outside of the studio. <eos> the monkey was by far the best piece of work i had created.
yesterday, i went over to my friend beth's house to have lunch and hang out. <eos> she put out some really neat pottery to eat off of. <eos> beth and i played around with our drink garnishes and laughed. <eos> we had a good day talking and hanging out. <eos> the most fun, however, was just being silly with her.
a woman named carol was very happy and excited because she was going to go sightseeing.  <eos> one of the things she saw while shopping were beautifully crafted cups.  <eos> her friend, nancy, also went with her, and took a break along a brick wall.  <eos> one of the sillier things they saw was a stone money with sunglasses.  <eos> at the end of the day, nancy was tired and shy about getting her picture taken 
the woman was felling awful.  <eos> doctors gave her the medicine she needed.  <eos> she rested, but she was beginning to recuperate.  <eos> soon, she was back teaching her students. <eos> she celebrated her health with dinner at her favorite restaurant. 
mom enjoyed a nice meal out before two days of hospital food. <eos> she was nervous but it's wasn't her first surgery. <eos> vital signs looked good but then again i'm no doctor. <eos> she'll be sore when she wakes up. poor mom! <eos> one week later, mom is already back at work! she's a tough cookie.
a woman is sick in a hospital bed. <eos> her nurse brings her her medicine and juice. <eos> she relaxes hoping that the rest will heal her body. <eos> she returns back to work. <eos> and is able to eat soon.
grandma was admitted to the hospital last week.  <eos> she was given medication and some juice to make her feel better. <eos> the hospital kept her overnight to make sure she was feeling better. <eos> next week she was back at work being a teacher. <eos> we took her out for dinner to celebrate her getting better. 
last year i was not feeling well and my doctor admited me into the hospital for some tests.  <eos> i was diagnosed with an illness that could be managed with proper medication. <eos> i gradually got better and stronger. <eos> within a few days i was strong enough to go back to work. <eos> now i watch my diet and i exercise regularly. i'm on my way to a full recovery.
early morning heading to school <eos> the young girl is starting to perk up and smiles with her juice <eos> dad and the kids arrive at school  <eos> a neat preschool board hangs on the wall to greet everyone <eos> the room is so huge and the girl is very excited to be there
look ! it's the first day of school and i'm so excited. <eos> dad is helping me get over my nerves by taking me. <eos> one last wave to my adoring fans before i go in. <eos> walking with dad into the room and getting a feel for my surroundings. <eos> i'm making new friends already and looking at the toys.
this is my daughter on her first day of school, she's so stoked. <eos> she practically dragged me up the stairs with her excitement.  <eos> she waved to the empty parking lot to let everyone she was ready to awesome. <eos> the play room practically glowed in front of her, she was ready to dominate her fellow classmates. <eos> this was my last image of her, she told me that all of the toys belong to her and kids need her permission to use them, attagirl. 
the little girl was nervous riding to her first day of preschool. <eos> during the ride her nervousness turned into excitement. <eos> dad and her baby brother walked her into her school. <eos> she was happy to see the colorful board in the hallway. <eos> as soon as she got to her class she made a friend and played with a bike.
in the car on the was to the first day of pre-school. <eos> she waved goodbye to our house. <eos> we arrived and walked into the school for the first time. <eos> the teacher had made a really cute bulletin board. <eos> she was nervous but jumped right in and began playing with the other kids.
the students collaborated on a project. <eos> it was a type of robot. <eos> the teacher gave general guidelines on what to do next. <eos> the students listened and made adjustments. <eos> they left the projects to complete another day.
kenny, mike and lea decided to enter the robot building contest. <eos> the did some research on the internet. <eos> then they started making a plan. <eos> they have made part of the bottom of the robot. <eos> they're excited to finish the project.
this is a class on robotics.  <eos> this is what the prototype looks like, although unfinished.  <eos> it was designed by first making a list of components.  <eos> then they made computer images.  <eos> when finished, it will compete against others for prizes. 
this was going to be a problem.  <eos> they would have to take the damn thing apart.  <eos> analyze it.  <eos> reconfigure it.  <eos> and put it back together again. 
the robotics team was working on their project. <eos> they had all the parts that they needed. <eos> next they just needed to come up with a plan <eos> the team couldn't agree on anything. <eos> so they decided to take a break and get coffee.
the kids were having track that day <eos> little lucas needed some water <eos> the kids were giving it all the had <eos> and helping each other along the way <eos> the mothers couldnt be more proud 
we had a track meet this weekend. <eos> everyone worked hard for this moment and tried to take first place. <eos> only one can win through and bob made it first. <eos> everyone was really excited and did their best. <eos> it was a success that will be repeated next year.
tom was getting ready for the track meet up. <eos> his friends were helping him by chasing after him. <eos> this wasn't good for toms nervous though so he can faster. <eos> he finished his lap and turned around because he heard some one call his name. <eos> it was just steve trying to hit him with one of the batons. grow up steve.
the race had started... <eos> and aaron was awaiting his turn, he even had a drink. <eos> and, then his teammate was closing in... <eos> and, aaron grabbed the baton and was off! <eos> his mother and sister cheered from the stands!
we went to christian's track meet. <eos> we gave him some energy drinks, <eos> but it was time for his race. <eos> he received the baton from charles. <eos> we had a great time watching his team.
we had a great time in class today. <eos> there were many group projects that we needed to do. <eos> it required a lot of collaboration. <eos> it was a lot of fun. <eos> afterward we were all given a grade.
it was job day and everyone was ready to hand in their forms.  <eos> one girl wrote her information on a small card.  <eos> the interviewer had trouble reading her tiny card, so she asked her to hold it up. <eos> another interviewer was laughing at the sad group of candidates that showed up for the job fair. <eos> the winner of a job was finally selected and received their first paycheck. 
we had open campus day at our school this week. <eos> many people showed up to discuss the school and what is so different about it. <eos> the students were there giving their impressions. <eos> we also had the classroom open for people to visit. <eos> the teachers were great, it was an awesome day.
i'm taking a banking class so that i can get a promotion. <eos> this requires much too much thought. <eos> card goes in this way. <eos> i just wish everyone would sit down so i can see. <eos> this is the questions and answers part. very personal, not with a group.
career day at school. lots of good information! <eos> and a lot of good material about any profession you can think of. <eos> but our friend amy was having a hard time deciding what to choose. <eos> then we took a 15 minute break to stretch and clear our heads a little. <eos> now it's time to meet with the counselors to answer our many questions.
the family was gathered in the living room.  <eos> the two boys waited outside for the school bus.  <eos> dad gave cyndi a big smooch.  <eos> cyndi has time to watch tv before going to school.  <eos> that's the bus that will take all the kids to school. 
daddy kissed me goodbye and sent me off to my first day of school. <eos> it was lonely walking to the bus stop. <eos> but it only took a minute before i made a new friend. it was his first day too. <eos> before i knew it i had a whole bunch of new friends. <eos> the school bus pulled up and we boarded. ready to start a new adventure.
the family was awaiting, it was the first day of school all over again... <eos> but, it was a special day for one of the children... <eos> it was tara's first day of school ever! <eos> she was nervous and biting her nails... <eos> but, when the bus arrived, she jumped on and was off to kindergarten. 
i took the kids to the bus stop today. <eos> it was their first day on the bus. <eos> they were very excited. <eos> some of them were nervous. <eos> when the bus came they all got on and went to school.
it was the first day of school and all the kids were ready. <eos> they were heading out to the bus. <eos> the youngest daughter went to say goodbye to her dad. <eos> but she was scared about leaving. <eos> as the bus pulls up she decides she is ready and runs off.
the group was going to break ground on a new site <eos> they planted a tree  <eos> and had a long discussion about the past <eos> they remembered the fallen as well <eos> it was a beautiful day to be alive 
everything was planed out in advance <eos> there would be a tree planting  <eos> and a book presentation <eos> and a reef laying <eos> everyone will the go look at the view.
the group gathered for the ceremony. <eos> they all helped plant the tree. <eos> they talked about future plans for the land. <eos> then they laid a ceremonial wreath. <eos> the area will be a great tribute when it is finished.
the veterans memorial was a long and gruelling process to procure. <eos> details took weeks to settle for everything, from the size of american flag to fly, to the genus of tree to be planted. <eos> there was even a book written about it. <eos> but the day came to open the park, and it was all spectacular. <eos> the team could look out over there work and know they honored their servicemen well.
bill lost many friends in the war, and he was feeling particularly humbled at being asked to attend this meeting regarding the building of the monument. <eos> five weeks later at the ground breaking ceremony, bill was the first to lift the dirt. <eos> a contractor showed him what the finished monument would look like, and bill was thrilled by it's beauty. <eos> a year later, bill and his children visited the monument to find the names of his lost friends. <eos> they spent the remainder of the afternoon in the observation room, watching with delight as the crowd filed passed the new monument.
i start my day with my dog, petey. i love him so much! <eos> then i study in the park. <eos> i love hanging out by this big shade tree. <eos> this hat was a gift from my mom. <eos> here's petey again. time for bed. good night!
mara loves to read so many books.  <eos> she really enjoyed the book she was reading.  <eos> mara takes good care of her dog that she named scruffy.  <eos> sometimes she gets sad thinking about being away from her family.  <eos> she started smiling a bit because she knows we love. 
i went to the park with my dog today. <eos> i brought all my books to read. <eos> i took some pictures by the tree. <eos> i also brought a hat for myself. <eos> it was rather sunny out.
i took my senior photos today, i was allowed to bring my own props. <eos> first i brought my books because it's my favorite thing to do. <eos> then i bought my dog, because he's my best friend. <eos> next i took a couple black and white shots, i always thought they looked classy. <eos> at the end of the day, i was glad to be done posing.
we hired a professional photographer for the occasion. <eos> the girl laid on the blanket to read her book. <eos> she laid on the bench with her dog. <eos> the photographer used a black and white setting to capture this moment. <eos> lastly, the girl was very happy with the photos.
a day at the carnival with the family. awesome view from the skylift. <eos> walked around the entire park to see what they really wanted to ride first.  <eos> as nighttime fell, the lights came on. all the rides look so cool lit up. <eos> the giant wheel looks even scarier in the dark. <eos> the night was finished off with an awesome fireworks show.
we had an absolutely fantastic time at the fair this weekend! <eos> from booths representing local businesses to local craft vendors, much of the community was represented. <eos> our giant ferris wheel was a hit for fairgoers as well as a breathtaking sight of light. <eos> daytime activities for the whole family were offered along with a variety of live music.  <eos> our beautiful summer festival was capped off by a firework show to remember. 
we went to an amusement park for the day. <eos> we couldn't wait to ride the big ferris wheel. <eos> the carousel was fun at night.  <eos> the giant wheel let us see the entire park. <eos> the night came to an end with fire works.
the fair was in town so we decided to go. <eos> took a picture of the ferris wheel that we would be riding on later. <eos> johnny was having fun on the merry go round. he was all smiles. <eos> the giant wheel that we rode earlier looks fantastic all lit up at night. <eos> what better way to end a fair day then by a spectacular fireworks show. 
a full view of the amusement park from across the lake. <eos> the entrance to the park had a merry-go -round and a ferris wheel. <eos> the merry-go-round was all lit up a night. <eos> the ferris wheel was also lit up and looked incredible. <eos> they had a great fireworks show at the end of the evening.
five star restaurants are cool.  <eos> the only problem is that sometimes style takes the place of quantity.  <eos> and you get left with a disappointing plate.  <eos> but that doesn't happen if you know what to order.  <eos> and then you can think about desert. 
the restaurant we arrived at was beautiful <eos> we had reserved the entire place for ourselves <eos> the first course was diving and beautiful <eos> the second course was perfectly cooked <eos> dessert was to die for and topped the meal nicely
my husband made reservations for us at a very nice restaurant. <eos> they didn't give you much food.  <eos> there was only a few tiny pieces of meat. <eos> my husband ordered the steak. <eos> our deserts then came.
max took me to shay rouge tonight. it was so fancy.  <eos> we had pate de meat. it was $50 a plate!  <eos> i had to snap another picture of it because it was just a shock of how much it actually cost! we shared a plate and the waiter snubbed his nose at us.  <eos> next we had raw beef. it gets prepared and cooked for 3.9 seconds in the broiler and then served. wow it's cold.  <eos> the dessert after dinner was unusual. it contained fish eggs. for a $600 dinner it sure was crap!
getting the restaurant ready for customers to come in. <eos> this is one of our best sellers. <eos> you really don't get no food with this serving.  <eos> the beef is amazing and you get more of it. <eos> dessert anyone? look how small they are.
she started to hang the signs. <eos> they took a family photo. <eos> they look so happy together. <eos> grandma did not look very happy, though. <eos> the little baby was adorable.
people gather waiting for the fireworks to start when the sun goes down.  <eos> the first explosions light the night sky. <eos> another beautiful display of light. <eos> the color gets more vibrant. <eos> twin explosions as the end of the night approaches. 
today was the day. <eos> the big event. <eos> everyone was there. <eos> it was so exciting. <eos> i loved the show.
we sat out here for his anticipating the fireworks display tonight  <eos> around 9 pm they started to go off  <eos> they're where do many different colors mixed in with each other  <eos> as they went off they're was a hue of colors in the air  <eos> this one had the sky the brightest by far 
i told my husband we had to get there early. <eos> by the time we arrived people were setting up on the side of the road. <eos> and then the crowd got huge. <eos> but the end result of fireworks was worth it. <eos> the highlight of the night was the chaser fireworks.
you could almost smell the patriotism on this 4th of july. <eos> children everywhere were ready for the parade, waving the flag in their wagons pulled by their parents. <eos> the old battle hymns could be heard. <eos> how could one not be patriotic today? <eos> and how could you not end it with rockets' red, blue, and green glare.
i had a great time outside yesterday. <eos> we had a rally. <eos> there were lots of families watching from their porches. <eos> many families brought their children. <eos> they were all showing their support.
we gathered in the street for our neighborhood 4th of july parade. <eos> even the wee ones participated. <eos> some of the costumes were very detailed. <eos> the neighbors decorated their fence. <eos> to end the day the local fire department put on a fireworks display.
it was the biggest crowd ever for this year's 4th of july parade. <eos> this little guy proudly waved his flag. <eos> the costumes looked very authentic. <eos> the people behind this fence were grilling and it smelled great. <eos> it was finally dark and the fireworks show began.
everyone gathered for the 4th of july parade. <eos> the little boy proudly displayed the flag as he rode in the wagon. <eos> some of the people dressed up as the founding fathers for the parade. <eos> many people decorated their houses for the event. <eos> at the end of the day, everyone watched the fireworks.
we all came out for the july 4th fireworks display. <eos> the colors were bright and vibrant. <eos> this was my friends favorite, since his favorite color is blue. <eos> this was my favorite just because of the brightness. <eos> the grand finale was spectacular. what a great show!
fireworks are my absolute favorite part of independence day.  <eos> the different colors always catch my eye.  <eos> some of them are two toned and reach far into the night sky.  <eos> some burst into a blossom like a flower.  <eos> the fireworks that look like a star are my personal favorite.
my son ron wanted to watch the fireworks. the white ones are so cool mom!  <eos> he cheered when the green and pink ones exploded.  <eos> next up was the bright blue and whites. he was in awe.  <eos> after the blue was the pinks. i'm lucky i got this one as they exploded so fast.  <eos> the grand finale was so amazing, so bright and so loud. we held our ears and giggled. 
last monday i bought a new camera. <eos> i thought that the local 4th of july fireworks display would be a good time to try it out. <eos> i can adjust the shutter speed to give a blurry effect <eos> colors show up great even in the dark! <eos> it's also got a sport setting to let me take action shots!
we went to check out a local fireworks show this past weekend. this first explosion was pretty generic. <eos> this explosion was a bit cooler. it looks like waves of electricity. <eos> this blue one reminds me of one of those plasma ball lamps that you can touch. <eos> this red one was pretty similar to the blue one but was a little brighter. <eos> the show ended with an exciting array of multiple explosions. the show wasn't spectacular, but we couldn't complain because the show was free.
they decided to take the kids for their first fireworks show on july 4th. <eos> the colors were very bright. <eos> he enjoyed them very much, even with his ear protectors on. <eos> the show was coming to an end. <eos> it was a great display, and even the baby was happy they went. 
we took the kids to watch the fireworks at night. <eos> they had lots of fun looking at the different colors. <eos> they covered their ears to protect them from the loud noises. <eos> the show finally came to an end. <eos> the kids were ready to go to bed after the beautiful show.
the family took the baby to his first fireworks show. <eos> there were many amazing colors. <eos> it was baby's big brother's fifth time going, they have been taking him since he was a smaller child as well. <eos> more pretty colors and shapes. <eos> it's safe to say baby enjoyed himself.
i absolutely hate the 4th of july. <eos> every year we have to sit and watch these ugly, loud sparks in the sky. <eos> the kids seem to love it so i give in and take them to see them even though i don't want to. <eos> i've never understood the point. <eos> i'm glad it's over and there's a whole year before i have to do it again.
a mother and her child await the fireworks. the baby wears headphones as protection. <eos> the fireworks have started and they are filling the sky. <eos> th babies brother watches on as well and enjoys the fireworks. he to wears headphones so it's not to loud. <eos> the fireworks are nearly over, but still look awesome.  <eos> the littlest one of the group enjoys them as he looks upon the fireworks.
duke was excited for 4th of july. <eos> he couldn't wait to spend it with his owner, jane, and his brother, sparky. <eos> and then the fireworks began... <eos> they were so loud that they scared sparky! <eos> he ran inside, and jane had to go find him and hold him tightly to calm him down. duke wasn't scared, though. he loved the fireworks and couldn't wait for the next time he could watch those bright explosions high in the sky. 
these are my dogs sparky and leo. <eos> i really love my dogs, having lived with both of them since i was a child. <eos> usually on the 4th of july they're a little scared of the fireworks. <eos> this year, though, they're not scared at all -- they're finally used to it. <eos> i've been torturing them with gunpowder for a week!
duchess was all decked out for the fireworks viewing party. <eos> jamie giving buster some lovin'. <eos> the fireworks were awesome, as always. <eos> i couldn't believe how close we were to the fireworks. <eos> jamie took a selfie with buster after the fireworks.
the dog posed proudly in  <eos> the women loved her dogs, and she made sure to show them that through hugs. <eos> the fireworks were all different colors.  <eos> the fireworks were a great sight to see. <eos> the women was happy to receive kisses from her dog.
the group of friends brought their dogs to see the fireworks with them. <eos> they are very excited for the upcoming festivities. <eos>  the fireworks start out small and get larger. <eos> the next one is quite a display with shimmering silver. <eos> the woman is happy with her dog.
lacey, a newlywed, is having her first 4th of july party at her new home. she laughs at terry's joke. <eos> terry, her husband, waits patiently for the food to be done. <eos> lacey made an american flag cake for the occasion! <eos> the first of the backyard fireworks. this was a smaller firework, just to start the night. <eos> later into the display, terry lights up this firework that explodes in many small bursts. lacey loves the display.
a perfect 4th of july begins with friends and family. <eos> and the most patriotic cake you can find, of course. <eos> it's usually not difficult to find a person's love for their country when american flag cake is involved. <eos> if that should fail, break out the fireworks. <eos> they're sure to win anyone over.
i'm going to sit back and wait for the fireworks display.  <eos> that's the same idea i had. this is boring though.  <eos> ooh cake. how did they make a flag on each slice? awesome! <eos> the fireworks are about to begin.  <eos> there they go!
getting together for the 4th of july is a yearly occurrence. <eos> meek was glad to be there. <eos> the cake was so good. <eos> our fireworks were a dud though. <eos> they did end up doing great later.
aunt carole laughed at her nieces and nephews having fun in the pool.  <eos> uncle benny was out of it after eating three plates of food. <eos> the cake which was designed as the american flag was very delicious. <eos>  the family made sure to keep everyone safe when lighting the fireworks.  <eos> one of the best fireworks of the night concluded the family festivities.
the kids arrived early to register for the event.  <eos> some girls sold candy.  <eos> they got their faces painted.  <eos> this boy wanted to be a tiger.  <eos> everyone had fun at the event. 
it was a perfect day for face painting! <eos> we started off with ladybugs on some of the girls. <eos> then we moved on to whiskers and eyebrows on some of the boys. <eos> while the kids waited, they tried out our great bouncy castle. <eos> it was fun for everyone, and everyone was involved!
the fundraiser started off slowly, with just a few people coming to it. <eos> as the day wore on, the treats came out for the children. <eos> there was face painting as well. <eos> some children wanted some interesting face paints, like the little boy who wanted to be a tiger. <eos> then the bouncy castle came out and all the kids ran into it, especially the boys.
the local fair was so much fun! <eos> there was free face painting for the children. <eos> this boy had his face painted like a cat. <eos> lots of kids played in the moon bounce. <eos> a group of children sat in a vehicle, on display from the local car dealership.
the table had ladies in green shirts <eos> and girls selling candy. <eos> they were painting faces <eos> in many different designs <eos> and they also had a bouncy house.
he had many black and white photos. <eos> some of them were of family. <eos> many of them were of baseball. <eos> he had a few players he idolized. <eos> he was an avid fan of sport.
i went to the baseball game today. <eos> there were some great players there. <eos> one of them was injured during play. <eos> he had to go to the hospital. <eos> afterward we all went to a banquet.
a baseball player hits a home run. <eos> his teammates look on in awe. <eos> shortly after, he falls down gripping his chest in pain. <eos> they take him to the hospital and realize he had a heart attack. the owners of the team come to check on him. <eos> after the heart attack weakened him, he could no longer play anymore, and he decided to become a motivational speaker instead.
the game is timeless and it is necessary to pass the tradition to the youth. <eos> they were excited for the first pitch of the day to begin. <eos> the umpire carefully studies the outcome to make the proper call. <eos> with great victory comes sweet glory. <eos> the demonstration captivated the crowd.
my grandpa was a great baseball player. <eos> he had a very long career in the sport. <eos> he was even injured once but it didn't stop him. <eos> his whole team came to see him in the hospital. <eos> he even made it in to the hall of fame!
when the day started, these men began working on the cathedral. <eos> they installed a frame to structure the clock. <eos> these two men wasted most of their time and worked very little. <eos> they were replaced by two other workers who worked quickly. <eos> they were almost finished with the clock by night time.
the clock in the tower was overdue for restoration. <eos> the workers removed the temporary center of the clock face. <eos> finally, it comes free and the workers can move on to the next step. <eos> working on the scaffolding outside is scary, but necessary to get access to the clock face. <eos> we can't wait to see the clock when its fully restored.
getting ready to take apart the clock for the upgrade. <eos> all equipment in placed and now beginning to that the clock apart.  <eos> we have gotten the clock down now we can take it for its upgrade.  <eos> upgrade completed now we can proceed to replace the clock back up.  <eos> almost finished with replacing the upgraded clock back in place. 
the clock tower was in desperate need of repair. the scaffolding was the first step.  <eos> everything needed to be properly braced.  <eos> it was slow and difficult work.  <eos> everything had to be done very carefully. this part required two people to lift the clock face.  <eos> there we go, almost set now. 
after many years they finally are replacing the clock tower clock <eos> precision craftsmanship went into making the clock  <eos> they worked over 5 days to make it perfect <eos> they even brought in a specialist to see things along <eos> its going to be a great clock when its done
i took my dog out for a trip last week. <eos> i brought some ribs for the barbecue. <eos> the parks that we stopped by were very beautiful. <eos> when we got further north it began to snow. <eos> at night there was a huge fireworks show that we got to see.
my dog and i went to meet some friends at the park on my day off. <eos> we grilled out and i contributed ribs. <eos> the food was so delicious. <eos> we sat on a dock watched a beautiful sunset. <eos> we ended the night watching great fireworks!

it is going to be a great cookout.  <eos> i have all the food needed. fresh shucked corn. <eos> the best wieners ever! <eos> grilling it all up. <eos> and, slyly adding my secret ingredient.

today we went to the lake and attended a 4th fair. <eos> after we headed to the dock. <eos> we jumped in the water to take a swim and our friends went canoeing. <eos> after we went back to the fair to watch the fireworks show. <eos> we then went back to my house and had a party and had a fourth of july dessert.
i went down to the pier with my family last week. <eos> we ate at a restaurant by the water. <eos> the weather was great that day. <eos> we had a great time at the restaurant. <eos> after we finished we went down to the water to play some games.
there was an event on the docks.  <eos> there would be fresh food.  <eos> a nice little park,  <eos> and an explosion of fireworks.  <eos> we chatted over food and dessert. 
the family went on vacation, <eos> a group of friends haveing lunch. <eos> jon and jake getting ready to go bouting. <eos> the fire works show was amazing. <eos> at the end of the fireworks we had desert.
we went out by the water for the party. the view was gorgeous. <eos> the women stood on the deck and conversed with each other. <eos> the children went down on the dock and played in the water. <eos> later at night there were fireworks. <eos> and of course dessert.
i went to the pool yesterday. <eos> when i got home i put the baby to sleep. <eos> my mom was outside with the children. <eos> there were some people in my pool. <eos> the children were playing basketball nearby.
families were told about what to expect when their loved ones deployed. <eos> soldiers were in a meeting in another room. <eos> they filled out next of kin and other such data. <eos> they sadly made their way to the planes. <eos> wives and children looked on, proud but sad.
it was a beautiful day, and the family decided to hang out by the pool. <eos> even baby lily was excited to enjoy the sunlight. <eos> but, grandma maureen found a shady spot--she claims she doesn't like the heat. <eos> everyone had a wonderful time swimming in the pool and enjoying the day. <eos> but, chris and tim, who would have rather played ball than swim with us.
our family stayed in a resort that had a large swimming pool. <eos> while everyone else was busy doing all kinds of activities, the baby spent a lot of time sleeping. <eos> mom sat down watching the kids playing. <eos> some members of our family hang out at the pool. <eos> the boys played basket ball and had a lot of fun. we promised the children that we would return to this resort next summer.
when we arrived for our visit, grandpa was asleep on the couch. <eos> we decided to spend some time in the pool. <eos> our baby must take after grandpa, taking a nap as well! <eos> the family gathered around the pool, lounging and chatting the day away. <eos> later on, we went indoors to share in more conversation with grandma and her sister.
shouts for corporations to be held accountable for their actions rang through the air. <eos> dissatisfied with the ever-looming presence of coal and its impact on the environment, many people took to the streets. <eos> others protested in their own clever ways, calling out tax dodging executives and corporations. <eos> this sort of thing brings a community together, and the rhythm of hand drums somehow seems to help as well. <eos> and indeed, by nightfall thousands had gathered to speak their minds.
people lined up for the big political event. <eos> the warm-up entertainment was a singing political parodist. <eos> as the main event approached, more and more people filled the seats. <eos> the main event was an impassioned speech by a local politician. <eos> the politician's speech enraptured the crowd.
we had been waiting for a very long time for the performance to start. <eos> the first one up was the oldest man in town and he was going to perform on the piano. <eos> thousands of people listened as he played. <eos> next up were the speeches by the local politicians on stage. <eos> everyone was captivated by the speeches.
it is important to be active in your community and make your opinions clear.  <eos> today we are protesting at city hall! <eos> you can make your voice heard and have fun at the same time! there are a lot of creative people on hand. <eos> there are also some talented musicians. <eos>  we all must fight for what we believe in. it is harder to ignore the people when we are so united.
last week we decided to go downtown for a rally. <eos> a lot of people got very passionate and were dressed in costumes. <eos> these baseball outfits were very unique and spoke volumes. <eos> some people showed up with musical instruments to enforce their message. <eos> we had such a big crowd there that day i think we really got our message across.
the 4th of july party was amazing. <eos> there was lots of colorful fireworks on display. <eos> we saw all sorts of different patterns and some had cool sparkles. <eos> our favorite was the firework that had all sorts of different colors in one. <eos> this was the best fireworks show we have ever seen.
boom, boom, boom the fireworks sounded.  <eos> colors of green, purple, pink and white exploded in the sky.  <eos> the crowd was mesmerized.  <eos> brilliant greens and red trailed down to earth.  <eos> pink, blue and white compelled everyone to look up. 
everyone gathered for the big event. <eos> the sky was lit up for miles around. <eos> people were in awe with what they saw. <eos> it was time for the grand finale. <eos> then the party got started again.
quite a crowd has gathered at the start of the display.  <eos> everyone was in awe at the large fireworks.  <eos> some were multi colored like this one.  <eos> others had several different sequences to them.  <eos> this one is pure white and misty, but still awesome looking. 
this year's 4th of july celebration was spectacular. <eos> the fireworks were closer than normal. <eos> the crowd gathered around to get the best view. <eos> there were some fancy fireworks, containing multiple colors and patterns. <eos> it was a great day to spend with family and friends.
it was very loud at the parade. <eos> there were many interesting cars. <eos> i took a lot of pictures there. <eos> there were also a lot of signs. <eos> i watched the parade for hours.
the firetruck making too much noise. <eos> playing the trumpet for the crowd. <eos> dancing with her friend. <eos> promoting her campaign. <eos> gathered all her candy. 
our town is so patriotic and so full of life. we love going to the annual parade. daria had to plug her ears as the engines went by. <eos> this is our town mayor and he is so funny. he is in the parade every year. <eos> then the music started coming down the street, it was fun but i have heard better music. <eos> this was my favorite float of the day. god bless america! <eos> this was the end of the parade, it truly was a fun time with the family!

everyone from the town gathered to attend the homeowner's association meeting.  <eos> lea didn't agree with some of the proposals raised at the meeting. <eos> bob was just thinking about going home to eat some pizza and watch tv.  <eos> the presenters made a joke about pooper scoopers.  <eos> tim looked at his wife who arrived late to the meeting.
it was time for the navaro actors yearly guild meeting. <eos> fred and james took the stage and started the talk. <eos> erik wasn't too happy about this because he had wanted to be one of the starters. <eos> kathy and kit enjoyed the starters though. <eos> rachael just wasn't amused. she had had a bad day and just wasn't feeling it.
these three people are charged with consorting with satan deep in the forest at night.  <eos> they plead innocent at the village meeting. gina voted to drown them. <eos> tim voted to stone them--not with rocks, just some mushrooms he'd saved from the druid daze festival. <eos> jen and tod abstained because they'd been in the woods with the accused and didn't want to be ratted out. <eos> will (who hadn't been paying attention) decided to vote with the majority. the accused will be stoned at dawn.
quite a few people came to listen to the speakers. <eos> the audience paid close attention. <eos> they seemed very absorbed in what was being said. <eos> they laughed at some things that were said. <eos> they learned a lot.
it was a sad day for mr. shakir, he never thought he would have to say goodbye to his beloved wife so soon. <eos> today was the day he would bury her and attempt to say goodbye to the life they shared. <eos> he told her so many times it wasn't a safe alternative to cigarettes. if only she would of listened she would still be here.  <eos> instead he is covering her grave in flowers.  <eos> and a headstone is being placed to mark the memory of her life. 
a man in blue comes to the cemetery to pay his respects. <eos> the man is coming to the cemetery to visit a loved one that passed away. <eos> a freshly dug grave covered in flowers. <eos> flowers surround a final resting place in the cemetery. <eos> the grave of a deceased man who was in the army and fought in korea.
joe went to see his mother's grave <eos> someone had planted a tree in place for her <eos> a lot of people payed tribute to her <eos> lot of memorabilia was left at the grave side  <eos> here was her tombstone 
we took a trip to an old cemetery today.  <eos> some of the graves looked lonely and not very well cared for. <eos> there were funny things scattered about as well. <eos> this grave looked recent and had a tone of flowers. <eos> it belonged to a loving wife and mother.
i go to my mother's gravesite once a year. <eos> lately, the place doesn't seem well kept up. <eos> i find a lot of litter on the ground, and try to pick it up when i can. <eos> there's always one or two graves completely covered with flowers, but others that seem to never see a visitor. <eos> i spend time sitting near my mother's grave, and think about how short life is. i miss her every day.
i woke up to the sound of helicopters after a night of binge drinking. <eos> there was a party going on around me. <eos> everyone wanted to meet me. <eos> even the mayor's wife showed up to shake my hand. <eos> someone gave me a flag which was weird.
we're here today to commemorate a fallen soldier. <eos> there are even helicopters. <eos> john apple, a brave soldier. <eos> may he rest in peace. <eos> the mother of john apple.
some came by helicopter.  <eos> they all wanted to pay their respects. the grave side service was overflowing with people.  <eos> many paid their respects to the parents.  <eos> respects were also paid to the sister.  <eos>  formally folded flags were presented to the family. 
today, on a beautiful peaceful day, we said goodbye to a loved one. <eos> it was a good turnout as we watched the casket lower into the ground. <eos> many people came by to offer condolences. <eos> even back at the house the family was overwhelmed by the love and support shown during this tragic time. <eos> the best part of the service was when the family was presented with the flags and thanked for their service.
it was a nice clear day for the service. <eos> many paid their respects as he was laid to rest. <eos> there were so many people who came to show their support <eos> many people shared stories about him. <eos> his family receives the flag in his honor.
today i decided to leave the house and go to the farmer's market. <eos> lots of fresh fruit and vegetables to choose from. <eos> i wanted to make a very colorful meal and these turnips looked nice. <eos> but i didn't have any meat protein for my dish. <eos> the meal turned out great and i was very proud of myself.
checking out the weather before i do some gardening. <eos> weather is cooperating so i bought the supplies. <eos> my husband got of photo of me and my favorite past time. <eos> later on we went to a farmers market for fresh veggies. <eos> the meal i prepared at the end of a long but pleasant day.
lizzie went for a drive and stopped at a farm.  <eos> there were many different lettuces to choose from. <eos> lizzie really liked how deep red the beets were. <eos> lizzie picked some vegetables herself.  <eos> back at home lizzie made herself a salad from all the delicious food she had bought at the farm. 
there was no traffic to hamper her plans. <eos> she went to the farmers market. <eos> a variety of vegetables were available for purchase. <eos> later her son took advantage of the good weather by exploring the outdoors. <eos> a good meal was prepared from the goods from the market.
she showed up to the product market. it was a nice day. <eos> here she is looking through all the fresh vegetables.  <eos> they had amazing red onions <eos> here are one of the workers picking them. <eos> and when you're done shopping, you can get a delicious salad. 
today's tour at the stair and ramp museum starts out with a creepy over-sized head statue.  <eos> i thought hey, why not take every picture in black and white, all the cool kids are! <eos> i don't know what it is about that ramp, but i just knew i'd regret it if i didn't get photos of it from many angles. <eos> then we got to this awesome semi-spiral staircase inside! watch your step on those platforms! <eos> our tour ended back outside, with a different set of stairs, by this point, i was convinced i had wasted my entire day.
we visited abandoned buildings near our house this weekend. <eos> it's eerie how quiet it is, even though there's buildings around. <eos> it looks like they were abandoned in the middle of construction. <eos> some parts are mostly finished. <eos> they even have working stairs in them.
kurt was practicing his photography.  <eos> he wanted to get better at black and white photos. <eos> this empty lot seemed like the best spot to start. <eos> he climbed up the stairs and took a shot of the door. <eos> then looked down them at what a beautiful scene he had created.
he preferred taking pictures of the old buildings in grayscale. <eos> he felt that it gave more character to the pedways... <eos> and, especially the exterior of the building.  <eos> he loved the way the light glared in the background. <eos> and, he finished his shoot with the downward shot of the stairs.
i bought some souvenirs on vacation last weekend. <eos> there were some bridges to get to them. <eos> there was no one else around. <eos> there was no one inside either. <eos> i spent some time walking around looking for somebody.
the stain glass windows were bright. <eos> the color of the walls were golden. <eos> the sun shone bright into the room. <eos> everything was set up and ready. <eos> the sky darken and cast a shadow in the back.
admiring the beautiful stained glass inside a house of worship. <eos> a lovely old church where we are going to worship today. <eos> the outstanding stained glass windows inside the church. <eos> a man coming to speak with god inside a beautiful church. <eos> to women come to worship in the house of the lord.
my first visit to an out of my state church. looks really beautiful. the windows are gorgeous.  <eos> the paint on the walls are exquisite. this is a lovely place to worship. <eos> more windows on the other side of this church. <eos> this room is quiet. i don't think i'm allowed in here. <eos> out in the yard, all the beautiful crosses.
this was one if the nicest churches they ever visited.  <eos> the painting was amazing.  <eos> as were the stained glass windows.  <eos> and intricate metal and wood work.  <eos> the headstones in the graveyard outside of the church were even detailed. 
this summer, i toured a beautiful cathedral.  <eos> it was really old, and very pretty on the outside. <eos> it had the most beautiful stained glass windows that i have ever seen. <eos> there were many rows of stained-wood pews. <eos> other people were touring as well.
everyone arrived for the family reunion. <eos> there was plenty of food and alcohol. <eos> mom was starting to have a little too much fun. <eos> many photographs were taken. <eos> after a long day of celebration i decided to take a nap.
looks like the ladies are gathering in the kitchen again. <eos> aunt kathy retreated to her favorite chair. <eos> while aunt mel is enjoying a cold one to celebrate the reunion.  <eos> uncle larry can't even stay awake. he hates these kind of things. <eos> it is great to see the whole family get together again.
this family gets together with grandpa every summer. <eos> mom shares her recipes with the daughter in law in the kitchen. <eos> mom and grand ma invited little tommy to come by for a drink. <eos> the daughter and daughter in law wanted to make sure to get a photo of little tommy. <eos> and of course bob dosed off on grandpas favorite chair.
we got the family together for a nice relaxing day, just to catch up on each others lives. <eos> i helped mom organize her kitchen, it was such a mess, but i had fun spending time with mom. <eos> we made some cocktails to drink. something mild but i knew mom would enjoy it. <eos> we had a lot of fun, we also took a lot of pictures to remember this blissful day. <eos> we caught dan sleeping! he couldn't handle all the amazing food we had eaten.
this month, my family had their annual reunion. <eos> my mom and grandmother made dinner for everyone. <eos> my great-grandmother, aunt, and grandmother took turns telling all kinds of stories. <eos> my cousin alicia took pictures of everything! <eos> my dad got so tired, he fell asleep watching television.
i'm so glad i had my camera with me today, during our stroll we came across this amazing building. <eos> as we got closer i was amazed at how gorgeous it really was. <eos> there were many religious statues placed throughout the grounds. <eos> although jason gets pretty bored with architecture, even he was in awe of the beauty!  <eos> it wasn't until about 15 minutes walking the grounds that we realized we were trespassing and were soon escorted off the property, but i couldn't resist to snap a few more picture on our way out! 
i went around town testing out my new camera by taking pictures of various buildings. <eos> i found out there's a lot of statues to be found too. <eos> some of the buildings are old and falling down. <eos> the artwork is impressive on some of them. <eos> i wish i could get closer to some to get a better shot of them.
we had a wonderful tour of the city looking at architecture. <eos> many of the buildings are adorned with art such as statues. <eos> the buildings themselves are works of art. <eos> intricate reliefs are to be seen everywhere and are magnificent.  <eos> the tall artistic columns are very imposing.
the day began with looking at old, fancy buildings. <eos> they looked at one building with statues of a adult figure with children. <eos> then, a martyr like figure was observed. <eos> they were astonished by the beauty of the carvings in the buildings. <eos> they walked down the road, amazed at what they had seen.
jesus statues freaked him out.  <eos> mary even more so.  <eos> he just didn't get it.  <eos> in his mind it was like having an imaginary friend.  <eos> and building enormous buildings, spending tons of money for it. 
a parade marking an election in britian. <eos> people watch what is going on below. <eos> reporters and photographers are on hand to capture the moment. <eos> various people milling about on the sidewalk. <eos> a man holding a sign during the parade.
the band played the music in a reverent way. <eos> they brought the casket out. <eos> they placed the casket in the hearse. <eos> the dignitaries followed behind. <eos> they had a gentleman give an account of the happenings inside.
there was a parade in london with a marching band from the military.  <eos> people watched from the building windows.  <eos> many more people watched from the sidewalks.  <eos> when the parade was over people talked about it together.  <eos> one man was determined to protest the event with a large sign. 
margret thatcher is honored by the british guards band. <eos> the community is saddened by the loss of margaret thatcher. <eos> even the news media is interested in the funeral procession of a great prime minister. <eos> many public officials will be by to honor the ex prime minister. <eos> some people are angered by the current prime minister and prefer thatcher to blair.
the marching band played a beautiful melody. <eos> there were even supporters that came out from a hotel. <eos> the event was very loud and important. <eos> we even saw a christian member of a church to support the gathering. <eos> even if somebody is christian, they can make mistakes.
today there was an assembly after class, it was voluntary, but i had nothing going on that afternoon so i attended. <eos> at first we thought it was about money around the world, but when the 2nd speaker came out with photos of a graveyard, we became very confused. <eos> unfortunately, i don't think the speakers realize standing directly in front of the screen will result in their face telling more of the story than they hoped for. we had a good laugh though! <eos> this was my favorite piece of equipment to learn about, many-a-nights walking home alone i've wished i had some kind of shank-like object on me, now i know exactly what to make! <eos> the afternoon had ended on the strangest note yet, this man didn't have anything to show us, he just came out, did a dance and ended the meeting.
antiques roadshow came to town and was giving a presentation on old items. <eos> they showed things that had a large value that no one would expect. <eos> this coffin top is easily worth a few million. <eos> then they had an open discussion about antiques. <eos> people could then get their items appraised live on the screen.
dave jansen gave a speech at my university last week. <eos> he talked about the importance of a good headstone. <eos> bob charley also showed up to do a skit with dave. <eos> they talked about self defense and blade safety. <eos> then a random girl in a yellow dress started dancing.
during the conference i spoke as clear as possible  <eos> when it was my turn to speak it was i reference to the ancient tomb stones  <eos> once all the serious was over at the conference our was basic on how to meet and greet customers <eos> up to date the materials are different in carving a tomb stone  <eos> to thank everyone for coming out and participating i sung a song
they were doing a fun talk on items from history. <eos> they talked about the different gravestones around. <eos> the two presenters bantered back and forth making the talk interesting and funny. <eos> they showed a lipstick knife. <eos> then one of the presenters dressed up like a lady drawing many laughs.
it was time for practice, and he wondered how they always managed to tangle the wires. <eos> it would be easy to trip over the wires, and even just standing there, he could see that. <eos> he adjusted the cymbals, wondering if the session would be successful. <eos> he began with one of the softer songs, loosening up his vocal cords. <eos> as his voice warmed up, he tested some louder notes, thinking this recording session would work out fine.
a drum solo during the concert for the fans. <eos> young man playing the keyboards during the festivities. <eos> slim young man playing the guitar and singing. <eos> checking the cables before the show to make sure everything is working. <eos> a person truly into their art sings for the audience.
this is the band. <eos> this is my shoes playing in with the band. i love to dance and sing. <eos> here goes the drummer doing his drummer thing. <eos> i'm singing a song called money, love and fun <eos> i think the crowd likes me.
the band member calibrates his instrument with a tuning device. <eos> poised and firm, the band member gets ready for the event. <eos> the drummer sets his cymbals to prepare for the gathering. <eos> the guitarist sings in a calm manner. <eos> then he swings his mood from calm to excited.
photographed an awesome band. <eos> there is so much that goes on behind the scenes than people realize. <eos> the drummer was setting up his drums to make sure everything was perfect. <eos> the lead singer and guitarist was on point in his practice. <eos> he sang a perfect song and played beautifully.
this was a very eerie yet beautiful place to take photos <eos> these old gravestones are surreal but captivating. <eos> the old font used in these tombs were very interesting. <eos> these tombs looked stood out for their uniqueness.  <eos> even the gate was very artistic. 
while at the art gallery viewing we saw some great work. <eos> during our time viewing the art we drank a little wine. <eos> my friends were amazed at the art and how great it looked. <eos> my husband was there enjoying his night after work. <eos> we ended up drinking a little too much wine but it was a fun night.
we decided to tour a historical cemetery. <eos> some of the headstones were beyond repair. <eos> the monuments were interesting to look at. <eos> some almost looked like buildings. <eos> it was an unusual experience.
there are so many stories about grave yards <eos> so i went myself and read up on the history <eos> took great pictures of the old buildings <eos> there also was the old graves that e encounted <eos> there is great history about this grave yard
i choose to take black and white photos today. <eos> an old leaflet i found on the floor of the cemetery. <eos> i tried to read this but it was in a foreign language. <eos> these must have been wealthy considering the size of the their tombstones.  <eos> and that concluded the day at the lafayette cemetery.
many people showed up in remembrance of the soldier. <eos> he was honored by his former comrades. <eos> they laid the flag over his coffin. <eos> his family showed up in his support. <eos> this family consists of two brothers and a sister.
there was a cube in the cemetery. <eos> so we went home instead. <eos> where we proceeded to open our mouths. <eos> then we took a better picture. <eos> i think i drove her away.
the funeral for the soldier was uniform. <eos> they gave him a proper send off. <eos> they folded the flag above his grave. <eos> mary and her brother attended. <eos> their family was reunited in this sad time.
a soldier's funeral includes folding the flag that draped the coffin. <eos> he died a hero and will be remembered by all whose lives he saved. <eos> after the flag is silently folded it is presented to family. <eos> i saw some old classmates that came to pay their respects. <eos> they hadn't seen the fallen soldier since high school but felt compelled to attend the funeral.
the soldiers stood at attention as they unfolded the american flag. <eos> as they continued to unfold the flag, the chaplain started the funeral service. <eos> the soldiers held the flag in honor over the casket. <eos> the soldier's children took a picture at the funeral, where they were honoring their father. <eos> the children and son in law took a picture at the funeral celebrating their father's life.
we took our first trip to the art museum today! <eos> there were so many different styles. <eos> this one seemed a bit out of place, but i guess that's the glory of art, it's all objective. <eos> i loved the paintings that looked so realistic! <eos> jason laughs at me, but i swear i found myself spending more time checking out gorgeous frames than i did the art itself! definitely planning another trip in the near future!
we went to a museum last week and took pictures of lots of paintings. <eos> our goal was to get design ideas for our new apartment. <eos> we liked contrasting colors. <eos> interesting sceneries were also part of it. <eos> we ended up loving this painting and asked them to buy it, but one million dollars was out of our budget.
we went to the art museum today. <eos> they had a lot of different styles displayed. <eos> there were portraits done with pencils. <eos> also still life paintings done with oils. <eos> my favorite were the flower paintings.
i went to the museum today to check out some paintings. <eos> i saw this really interesting painting of the last meal. <eos> diego rivera even had some of his early sketches in the collection. <eos> i was really inspired by a painting of sculptures, it was so realistic. <eos> i bought a print of my favorite painting of flowers from the gift shop.
for me, a walk through an art museum is better than a movie. this painting took to to the beach in my mind. <eos> here, i was transported into a long ago horse show. <eos> i may never go back in time to an ancient native american village, but i can go using the painting in my mind! <eos> or i can walk on the long ago streets of paris. <eos> i can imagine my lover has just presented me with this vase full of zinnias. my mind gets to go everywhere in a day.
the group of people were excited for their first family reunion. <eos> traveling all the way from idaho, the adams family were extremely delightful to visit. <eos> jill and janet found it hard to believe that their grandchildren were growing up. <eos> the smith's family proposed the idea of the reunion and requested to meet up in their hometown. <eos> even the jackson family were excited to find out the news.
lots of family members came from far and wide to attend the reunion. <eos> the entire family has not seen each other in many years. <eos> brothers and sisters who don't always see each other very often were reunited. <eos> the two oldest surviving sisters were ecstatic to see each other. <eos> many younger members of the family also came to the reunion.
there was an opportunity for the family to get photos together. here we are all together. <eos> this picture shows the siblings and their spouses. <eos> the two eldest in the group are here with each other. <eos> this is the younger generation of cousins. <eos> we were able to get one of just the four of us.
we got the whole family together to take a large family photo. <eos> all the sons and daughters got together for a photo. <eos> mom even got together with her sister for a photo. so many of us took a picture of this, they didn't know where to look. <eos> we also got the grand kids to take a few pictures as well for the photo album. <eos> finally we also got the immediate family members together to take pictures.
picture day, this is the one of the entire group! <eos> a subgroup within the family, great smiling faces. <eos> two amazing women, mothers, and grandmothers! <eos> a picture of some of the girls. <eos> a very sweet family who helps hold the large unit together.

i drove into the enclosure, past the red lights on the chain link fence. <eos> there used to be old growth trees in this area. <eos> the atlantis company destroyed the forests while strip mining. <eos> the company went bankrupt. the buildings were abandoned and closed off. <eos> some of the woods came back, ten years later.
an outside light guards the fenced in area waiting for construction crews.  <eos> a hand drawn rendering of what will eventually exist on the construction site.  <eos> mounds of dirt are ll that remain in the area that has recently been cleared away.  <eos> an old building is being destroyed to make way for a new day. <eos> an empty parking lot awaits the return of the builders to work on their construction project. 
this is some of my favorite pieces of art. <eos> here is several trees. i love this picture. <eos> sands and mountains. <eos> an abandon building <eos> a long corridor of trees.

the downtown area has lots of attractions and features wonderful lodging options. <eos> there are also lots of gas stations nearby in case you need to tour the city in your vehicle. <eos> there are also lots of restaurants, some of them fast food.  <eos> some of the restaurants also offer more formal sit down options. <eos> this time of year, the town will be decorated to celebrate christmas.
our road trip led us here for lodging. <eos> the city lights were bright that evening. <eos> this was a good place to dine. <eos> we stopped to fuel up before heading home. <eos> the moon was full and beautiful.
the hotel didn't have a bar. <eos> the downtown of this city was unknown to them. <eos> they tried many places to find a drink. <eos> but gas stations couldn't help. <eos> they stared into the moon until morning.
we drove around looking for a hotel room to stay at. first place we went to didn't have any rooms. <eos> then we came across a gas station that the gas prices were high. <eos> after that we passed a kfc. <eos> then we finally got a room at the lakeside. <eos> in the lobby was christmas tree with lights.

today we went to our friend krystle jozens 18th birthday party. <eos> everything started calmly enough with a little light music and lunch. <eos> we moved on to making home made ice cream. as you can see it was a hot day. <eos> as the evening went on we played games and won prizes. the birthday boy was dressed up as smurfette and pictures were posted to facebook. <eos> we had a blast at the party and have pictures and memories to prove it.
there are empty glasses on the table after everyone has had dinner. <eos> people are gathered around talking and catching up with their friends. <eos> people are lining up outside to take pictures at the photo booth. <eos> outside the photo booth there are many wigs you can pick from to wear, such as a blue wig. <eos> the pictures from the photo booth are so fun! 
the party invitations were creative and colorful. <eos> it was held outdoors and indoors. <eos> interesting foods made up the menu. <eos> friends came dressed in colorful attire. <eos> the rsvps were very high for this event.
we were treated with drinks before the event started. <eos> people were starting to arrive to be a part of something special. <eos> they were told to wear red and grey and most people complied. <eos> but this woman didn't she decided to wear blue hair. <eos> when everyone saw that they wanted to get silly.
my friend krystle's mother almost does too much for her birthdays. she always has a very fancy meal.  <eos> she requires a dress code---this year it was red and black, with ties for the men. <eos> i think krystle sometimes feels a little overwhelmed by all the fuss. <eos> her mother has this silly tradition of making her wear a strange colored wig during the party. <eos> krystle hated the hello kitty on the guest cards. she hasn't been into hello kitty since she was seven! her mother still sees her as a little girl.
i was so excited when i arrived at the party with my girlfriend.  <eos> i found my friends and we started telling stories together.  <eos> i went out on the water with my girlfriend in a paddle boat.  <eos> we headed back to the party and relaxed after the tiring paddle boats. <eos> we spent the rest of the night having a great time with all of our friends.

the pumpkins were perfectly carved for halloween. <eos> dracula was put in front of the house to scare trick or treaters. <eos> we went in search of free candy but mom didn't want to wear a costume.  <eos> the pumpkins looked really scary with lights inside of them.  <eos> sam came dressed as the grim reaper. 
we decorated a little bit for halloween. <eos> this included our front porch and pumpkins. <eos> we had a chair set outside waiting for visitors with candy. <eos> my friend was dressed up waiting in the bushes for people walking by. <eos> here is a victim about to get scared.
the pumpkins were laying on the porch. <eos> outside the home was a statue that stood tall. <eos> the home was very well lit from the outside. <eos> when we walked in, we loved the furnishing in the home. <eos> we wore creepy masks to hunt candy with.
halloween was last night! <eos> we decorated my house with vampire themed stuff. <eos> people began showing up around 6pm. <eos> the smiths across the street don't celebrate halloween. <eos> jeff came over dressed like a skeleton.

we take life as seriously as we are supposed to. <eos> when we get together we also take our food just as seriously. <eos> having endless rows of good food and friends is the best way to live life to the fullest. <eos> nobody said anything about us eating. sometimes it is the best time when you provide meals for others. <eos> everyone is welcome in our circle. we feed anyone in need of a good meal.
we set up the tables for the halloween party.  <eos> the first guest to show up was mark.  <eos> we set up fun games and prizes to play during the party.  <eos> other people arrived and got started eating.  <eos> someone brought a frankenstein mask and passed it around to the guests. 
the bike race is today and there are many different competitors. <eos> there is a twist: people dress up as their favorite book characters. this boy is a wereworlf. <eos> there are vampires and other creatures. <eos> dr. seuss characters are also popular choices along with superheros. <eos> there are also couples who pretend to be pirates sailing their bikes through the stormy seas.

there was a bicycle event today. <eos> some of the bikers even dressed up. <eos> this one in particular dressed up as a werewolf. <eos> other people had funny looking outfits as well. <eos> overall, it was a fun experience.
the party had the normal party elements of music and drinking. <eos> some of the guests partied harder than others.  <eos> a few of the guests were lost and in found themselves in the wrong place. <eos> normal party activities included drinking too much.  <eos> maybe driving home is not such a great idea. 
after driving around the neighborhood for a several minutes we finally found the halloween party. <eos> there were a lot of people dressed in strange costumes. <eos> they had some scary halloween decorations. <eos> there were some people that chose not to dress up. <eos> afterward we all danced together.
the drinks were cold and numerous throughout our halloween. <eos> there were scary costumes that took a lot of work to design. <eos> there were some guys who chose not to dress up at all.  <eos> as the night went on, shirts came off and the crowd got a little wilder! <eos> luckily we all made it home in one piece with the assistance of designated drivers.
halloween was a great night at the bar. <eos> they had spooky decorations up. <eos> they made fun of anyone not wearing a costume. <eos> they danced until dawn. <eos> they were exhausted and fell asleep in the car on the way home.
it's the annual halloween party, i went as a woman.  <eos> the bar always decorates well.  <eos> people who don't dress up get photo bombed. <eos> sometimes things get a little hot and steamy at the party.  <eos> everyone leaves having a good time.

bubba and chelsea decided to start a duo folk band called the twadles.  <eos> the twadles performed at retirement homes, and in day care centers. sometimes bars.  <eos> chelsea performed songs she'd written, and her voice was soft as silk. <eos> chelsea also played a mean piano. deep soulful ballads are her specialty.  <eos> last song for every performance is love is a bridge, a song bubba wrote especially for his wife, chelsea. 
this couple played at the bar recently. <eos> the sounded so well together. <eos> the female singer had an angelic voice. <eos> she not only played the guitar, but then she got behind the keyboard. <eos> she rocked a solo. such a great show.
i went to see my favorite band play tonight. <eos> they played all of my favorite songs. <eos> sandy played the guitar through most of the concert. <eos> though she switched to keyboards for a while. <eos> she can really rock out on the keyboards!
we went to see an underground rock show. <eos> it was a lot of fun. <eos> the singer had a nice voice and the songs where smooth. <eos> she played keyboard near the end of the set. <eos> for the final song she sang and played guitar.
the band was performing tonight. <eos> they were in sync today and the crowd was loving it. <eos> the leader singer was singing with all her heart. <eos> she even played the keyboards. <eos> she had her own solo as well.
costume time at our favorite bar, we made sure our costumes were extra lame. <eos> some of our friends went out as drunkards, that's right, drunkards. <eos> we put on our best shitty selfie faces whenever our pictures were taken. <eos> this guy's homer simpson was really shitty, it was kinda scary. <eos> but, at least we got to see a creepy frankenstein and an old dude.
we had a great costume party this week. <eos> all my friends showed up dressed up. <eos> some with more clothes than others. <eos> masks were aplenty and funny. <eos> it was a great party which we will certainly repeat.
these two sisters were wild that night. <eos> cutest couple of the night award to these two. <eos> they were talking about some dirty stuff when i walked over. <eos> homer simpson and pukashell man! <eos> these four didn't understand the holiday at all.
its halloween and the couple dressed up. <eos> the friends are enjoying each other company. <eos> they are so serious. <eos> these guys are really enjoying their self. <eos>  these friends costumes are interesting. it was very good night for all these friends.
friends gathered for a halloween party. <eos> some of the costumes showed very little effort on the part of some of the party goers. <eos> other party goers did not have costumes at all, and they were not smiling much. <eos> then there were the people who tried to put on a good show and they seemed very happy. <eos> a group of people put a lot of effort into their costumes, living up to the spirit of the halloween party.
it's almost christmas time. <eos> the children begin to open their presents. <eos> they really love what they got. <eos> our son really likes his new bike. <eos> we had a very fun time.
just as football practice was finishing up today my parents told m they wanted to go and pick fruits. <eos> so we all got in the car and drove several hours away to a place that had fruits to pick. <eos> the trees there were so big we needed to use a ladder to get at the fruits. <eos> my dad was very hungry after that long drive and he ate a lot of them. <eos> afterward my parents bought me a present after the drive home.
here our little guy is well dressed for christmas church service! <eos> we had a great time opening presents as a family. <eos> he was ecstatic to receive this present! <eos> he loved his big wheel bike! <eos> our family loves spending time outdoors too.
the child was raised in a very happy household. <eos> him and his brother were given lots of toys for christmas. <eos> he got a castle that always wanted. <eos> the boy also got a big wheel that he would practice riding. <eos> the boy was very happy and loved his family.
our children are growing up fast. <eos> looking back on these photos from the 1980's i can tell how much life has changed. <eos> i remember him being so excited to receive masters of the universe castle. <eos> his big wheel took him everywhere. <eos> but the best memories were not surrounded by toys, but by the ones he loves.
a crowded city street that is close to the market. <eos> shoppers picking out fruits and veggies at the market. <eos> once everything is bought it's home to prepare dinner. <eos> another stand selling a variety of wares. <eos> scooter rental shop in case you don't want to walk.
there's no better way then enjoying a trip around town during a summer weekend. <eos> not only were the markets full with so many products but most had good quality such as the fruits. <eos> for some reason, a lot of bikers were present, <eos> even on the streets <eos> my vehicle was beaten up, but it fits the occasion!
i visited a city in asia that was very busy and congested. <eos> i went to a market and enjoyed looking at all the stalls. <eos> later, i hopped in a bicycle rickshaw pedaled by a local. <eos> we went through the city streets and watched the people. <eos> finally, the driver allowed me to take his motorized wagon out for a spin.
a year ago a family visited a vietnamese city. <eos> the local market was filled with fruits and vegetable of the area. <eos> they watched a local chef prepare food with meats and fish. <eos> the local fish market sold fish from the waters that surrounded the city. <eos> at the end of the day, they rested and watched the local people relax by the side of the road.
the streets of cambodia are very disorganized. <eos> however, inside the market, were beautiful displays of fruits and people. <eos> the meat market also had an interesting sight. <eos> here is the fish market with a wide variety of fish. <eos> lastly, we got to see cab drivers taking a break from their hard work.
some people went over the top when it came to trying to be scary. <eos> a few jack-o-lanterns were reported murdered. <eos> some jack-o-lanterns are better looking than others.  <eos> halloween night even brings them out of the graves. <eos> strangers knocking on your door on this night are to be greeted with caution. 
the davidsons went all out for halloween last year. <eos> they carved jack-o-lanterns, and some were whimsical. <eos> some of the jack-o-lanterns were downright scary. <eos> there was even a hearse as part of the spooky decorations. <eos> neighborhood parents and trick-or-treaters were frighteningly impressed.
we went to visit my friend last week. he loves halloween. <eos> he always makes the craziest jack-o-lanterns. <eos> he really enjoys it. <eos> he takes extra time to put up great decorations. <eos> all of the kids love going to his house.
it was halloween night, and the family decided to trick-or-treat together. their first stop was a graveyard in their neighbor's lawn.  <eos> having made it through safely, they were greeted with an attacked pumpkin on the porch.  <eos> not to be outdone, the next neighbor had an exaggerated face on her pumpkin - more odd than scary. <eos> the last house featured a ghoul enjoying some tombstones. the children were ready to return home. <eos> the other relatives at home greeted the team as they returned from their scary visits. 
for halloween this year we decorated the entire house in ghosts and pumpkins. <eos> for this pumpkin, we carved it out and gave it face before completing destroying to scare people. <eos> we painted this pumpkin with makeup on it to make it look like a lady pumpkin. <eos> the trick or treat kids were terrified when they saw the skeleton body. <eos> while some people ran away from the house we did have people that made it to the front door throughout the night.
a view from the top taking in the sites from below. <eos> a church waiting for the faithful to arrive. <eos> rows and rows of pumpkins for the autumn season. <eos> touring a very large mansion while on vacation. <eos> dropping into the shops for some nick nacks.
the trains roared by as we waited for our ride. <eos> when we arrived to the city, the weather was wonderful. <eos> we got to visit many historical buildings. <eos> we stopped at a produce stand along the way. <eos> at the end of the day, we visited the shops.
i rode the train in to the city one fall day. <eos> the town was dressed for fall, with crisp air and changing tree colors. <eos> the cathedral at the heart of the town looked especially lovely in the light. <eos> a vendor had a bunch of pumpkins out for sale, which i admired. <eos> i walked through the streets and admired the architecture and decorations.
beautiful view of the majestic gardens.  <eos> old chapel lying on the hills. <eos> new pumpkins everywhere as the season begins.  <eos> old victorian style castle is an amazing view.  <eos> shop and a old with old hanging clock adds to the elegance of the area.
this is where everyone met up for the fall halloween tour. <eos> our first stop was an old church. <eos> next, we got to buy our own pumpkins to carve. <eos> our last stop was the giant mansion. we didn't see a ghost, but maybe next time. <eos> after the tour, we went out for coffee.
mike the mermaid commands his minions from his throne. <eos> among them are big evil cat face man. <eos> finger that thinks people are braille, and subsequently crushes them. <eos> and creepy naked monkey cat thingy. <eos> for transport, they all share a scooter. the snowglobe decides who gets to use it.
anna and todd were stranded in the rain <eos> they were able to get bikes to travel. <eos> they took the bikes and traded it in for a vespa, and continued to travel around the world.  <eos> on their downtime they liked to do puzzles. <eos> at the end of the trip tony left anna for another woman.
a mermaid was stranded on the beach and began to take a nap. <eos> he dreamed that a giant, evil cat was going to come and get him. <eos> the girl in the dream read braille in order to call for the monkey to save them.  <eos> the monkey came to help him. <eos> the monkey gave the girl a scooter so she could escape the cat.
in the countryside, the torrential rain made travel difficult. <eos> in the city, everyone complained about the crowded streets. <eos> the fortune teller told her clients that they needed to taste the open road and get away. <eos> everyone was dissatisfied with their life but was puzzled as to how to improve it <eos> running away seamed like the only answer.
gina and mike had to travel through the rain. <eos> after a long journey, they asked a man for directions to the bike store. <eos> along the way, we took a photo of a nice bike. <eos> the journey seemed to be a puzzle because we kept getting lost. <eos> however, through the struggle and rain, we found the perfect bike to buy.
last night was a lot of fun. i hung out with a bunch of my friends at a house party. <eos> there were a lot of people there. <eos> some of them were just watching t.v. in the living room. <eos> there were also a lot of people outside on the porch. <eos> there were some other people playing around in the bedroom.
parties at jeff's place are always a blast. <eos> the guys are always down to party. <eos> but you better keep ben away from the cake. <eos> the girls are proven party animals themselves. <eos> beth may or may not have had an adult beverage with her teddy grahams that night.
a bunch of friends gathered for a party. <eos> they danced barefoot in the kitchen. <eos> then they sat on the sofa and talked. <eos> afterwards they gathered on the back porch and had fun. <eos> finally, they wrestled around on the floor.
all the guys at the start of a fun night <eos> getting a little dancing on after some drinks <eos> they were stuck inside doing homework <eos> we were outside enjoying the perfect spring weather <eos> things got a little weird
we had some friends over for a graduation party. <eos> everyone had a lot of fun and we drank a little bit more than the usual. <eos> good thing one us found a box of old donuts, since no one brought any food over. <eos> the weather was very nice, so we spent most of the time on the porch. <eos> some pictures will definitely remain a secret only to the one attending the party.
halloween night. out with friends. <eos> downtown is crowded. <eos> rubbing shoulders with everyone. <eos> met this great couple. <eos> they're getting a little bit too friendly.
these friends were some kind of evil demons and demons. <eos> this lady did a great medusa. <eos> the halloween party was on, and there were lots of costumes to see. <eos> this guy found an interesting way to proposition women. <eos> but in the end, no one could compete with this perfect terminator.
we were ready for a night of partying out of the town. <eos> apparently, so was the rest of the city! it was a huge turnout! <eos> we couldn't all fit inside, so we just partied on the street. <eos> we saw some pretty disturbing costumes. <eos> but everyone was obviously having a good time, and that is what we were that for!
group photo of us at a halloween festival! <eos> it was crazy packed that night. <eos> the city streets were full of costumed drunks! <eos> here is dan looking for affection... <eos> and he gets his wish!
my friends and i all dressed for a party! <eos> these people stretch on for miles! <eos> such an exciting night everyone is having fun! <eos> look at these crazy characters! <eos> these guys were my favorite, they were so weird!
i got to pick out my first pumpkin to carve, today! <eos> my sister and brother were there, too. <eos> i really think my sister got the biggest one out of all of us! <eos> my brother insists his is the best, though. <eos> i'm just happy that i had fun today, and i want to do it again, sometime!
it's been two weeks since the pumpkins first appeared, the kids don't seem to know any better. <eos> these pumpkins have murdered over 40 people nation wide, it's good that the kids don't know we're being held hostage. <eos> this pumpkin could snap at any second and cut off my daughters head, i almost vomited after this picture. <eos> look how happy he is, he doesn't know the damage this pumpkin has caused. <eos> it's like the pumpkins are mocking me, they know how much these pictures hurt my soul.
the family went to a pumpkin patch. <eos> they had tons of fun with pumpkins. <eos> they loved how big and round they were. <eos> even the youngest got in on the fun. <eos> they loved their time at the patch.
the whole family went out to the pumpkin patch together. <eos> the brother and sister chose one pumpkin each. <eos> the sister was so happy with hers! <eos> the brother also loved his pumpkin. <eos> the other sister was happiest of all, though, because she got four pumpkins.
halloween is her favorite holiday.  <eos> this boy and girl picked the pumpkins they wanted to carve.  <eos> she said she is going to carve a princess on her pumpkin.  <eos> he wants to carve batman on his pumpkin.  <eos> "she can't decide which pumpkin she wants to take home. ""can i take them all"""

invitation to the fangoria event. <eos> a couple dressed for the fangoria party. <eos> a girl sings at the party for entertainment. <eos> gentleman sings a the party to entertain the party goers. <eos> someone had a bit of a problem while getting to the party hence the bloody outfit.
we went to the fangoria halloween conference. <eos> first, this lady spoke about costumes. <eos> then, this guy spoke about makeup and wigs to complete the ensemble. <eos> then we got to walk around and see examples of how costumes and makeup can be combined to create a scary effect. <eos> here's one of our favorites.
fans were there to meet some of the creepiest horror actors of all time <eos> they asked the hard questions to the cast <eos> even freddy got in on the action <eos> this guy was dressed as a scary monster <eos> and here this guy was about to cut someone to pieces 
we went to the halloween convention and saw this beauty. <eos> this lady speaker took the time out of her work to speak about the festivities of halloween. <eos> this speaker gave a heartfelt story about the fantastic times he had on halloween. <eos> there were dedicated cosplayers at the convention. <eos> there never seemed to be enough of cosplayers at the convention.
my friends and i had an awesome halloween party! <eos> we had so many snacks and appetizers, the assortment was endless. <eos> we even had cake pops that looked like eyeballs! <eos> and look at this scary dip bowl! <eos> everybody had a blast.
the eyeballs were cooked just right; not too rubbery, but not too squishy, either. <eos> the flocked priest warded off the shepherdess zombie with a holy sign and his rather strong body stench. it was enough to turn off the undead.  <eos> an innocuous gourd, set among other delicious entrees, contained the remains of a microsoft's intern's brain. someone had thoughtfully left a clean spoon to scoop it with.  <eos> the zombie shepherdess was impressed by the shocking gesutre from david lee roth. fish man, however, was not.  <eos> plain jane, the barkeep, enjoyed the show, and would keep smiling, until they later burnt her at the stake, mistaking her for a witch.
it was a halloween party.  <eos> check out our finger food and treats.  <eos> vanilla tasting eyeballs.  <eos> scary head in the bowl of tortillas.  <eos> a hug for the devil. 
"what are you dressed up as for halloween he asked? <eos> they had pumpkin soup before halloween night.  <eos> does anyone one want some ""eyeball"" cookies?  <eos> a scary head was in the chip bowl.  <eos> "the couple had a great time at the halloween party. now it is time for them to go out. 
friends having fun at the halloween party.  <eos> table full of appetizers.  <eos> eating eyes for desert.  <eos> chips and bloody brain dip made of salsa.  <eos> boyfriend and girlfriend having fun.
this little doll was feeling very sad. <eos> this little doll was feeling like she cant go on anymore. <eos> this doll was very evil and putting spells on the other dolls. <eos> this doll was very happy with life. <eos> this doll was about to whip someone with her cane.
i have always collected dolls but i have only just discovered these macabre little things. <eos> ghoulie little girls with sunken eyes and black circles. <eos> this one could be the dead version of madame butterfly. <eos> or what about the teen angst gothic girl. <eos> they even have a ghoulie little bunny for her pet. i love innovative ideas.
the dolls were all arranged nicely. <eos> one of them kept falling off the chair, though. <eos> the tall female doll looked very elegant. <eos> they all sat nicely for their photos. <eos> it was a great occasion for all!
i was frightened by the little doll even though i knew she wasn't real. <eos> another doll flailed on the chair looking drunk. <eos> a leather-clad platinum blonde lectured the pumpkins. <eos> serene in a kimono, a placid doll rested on a fainting couch. <eos> this one was the most lovely, all in earth tones.
doll collecting is one of my favorite hobbies. <eos> there's is no limit to how creative you can be with the doll's outfits.  <eos> i even like to dress them up for holidays. <eos> this doll is very rare and the kimono is 100% silk.  <eos> i have to be very careful because this is a porcelain doll. 
my girlfriend really like a cat as her pet and she is very artistic.. <eos> this is the place where we express our feelings in the way of art. <eos> this jacky taking a pose on our art room. <eos> my self wanted to say something. <eos> also karen our belly dancer take a pose on our art room.

i really love kittens. aren't they beautiful.  <eos> my friends and i decided to take pictures posing in our room that we made turn out to look of nothing but cats. <eos> we are all making silly poses to take. <eos> our friend here decided to just stand there and not show any emotion at all. <eos> my friend here decided to dance to her music all while making different poses for the camera.
the photo shot was hipster themed.  <eos> people posed in the middle of a dirty room. <eos> some had dramatic poses. <eos> others didn't know what to do. <eos> but this lady made sure to make the most out of the experience.
at the halloween party, one woman dressed up as a cat. <eos> it was held in a very dirty house. <eos> everyone had fun posing for photos. <eos> some people didn't dress up, though. <eos> regardless, everyone had a great time!
last night i was trying to figure out what we were going to do and then i had a great idea. <eos> i gathered all my friends and we all went to hang out in the pool. <eos> so many of my friends showed up. <eos> afterward we all were hungry so we went to grab something to eat. i brought my scary mask to scare everybody. <eos> after we ate we decided to climb up on my roof and hang out until morning.

the jones children always act silly. <eos> even when they are hurt, they love to clown around. <eos> it makes for a very happy family. <eos> and a vey silly family, sometimes too. <eos> happy kids equal a happy life.
a new baby came home to meet the family <eos> he had an older brother and an older sister. <eos> they played with their little baby brother and watched over him as he grew. <eos> they were the best of friends. <eos> halloween was one of their favorite holidays. they had fun making their costumes and going trick-or-treating.
everyone had fun at the costume party. <eos> the costumes ranged from wild to realistic. <eos> some resembled everyday night wear. <eos> others resembled creatures from horror movies. <eos> a few looked great in pairs.
mandy was certainly adventurous at the party with this little number. <eos> brian was the life of the party with this joker's outfit. <eos> suzy was all smiles in a bloody roman toga. <eos> kate and justing needed some fresh air. <eos> kevin and debra were total opposites at the party.
everybody loves a good costume party, and our friends are no exception! <eos> we had a little of everyone show up, and we all drank and were merry. <eos> some costumes were hip. <eos> other costumes were scary. <eos> but one thing we all had in common was the spirit of fun and friendship.
we went to a costume party for halloween. this lady won the prize for least costume worn. <eos> we have no idea who this guy was supposed to be, but he sure was fun to party with. <eos> this guy tried to be someone from a boy band. <eos> one of our friends dressed up as death. <eos> here's us - not a very cohesive couple for costumes this year!
she was bad bad girl that night <eos> jack was crusing for some hot guys with some hot buns  <eos> joey was interested in jack! <eos> darth maul showed up and caused trouble <eos> he left with the hottest chick at the party!
johnny and his friends were ready for halloween. <eos> little charley dressed as a duck, which was his favorite animal. <eos> they moved through the neighborhood looking for houses to trick or treat at. <eos> they saw the perfect house and rang the doorbell. <eos> johnny was a little upset that they only gave him one piece. on to the next house.

it was halloween costume day on tuesday. <eos> i dressed tommy us as a little yellow duckling. <eos> on the way home we saw someone decorated their yard like a graveyard. <eos> another building decorated their stoop with scary decorations. <eos> billy the pumpkin is scared very easily and doesn't like halloween.
we arrived at the house and it was resplendent in spookiness. <eos> we mingled and took pictures of the scenery. <eos> a wraith floated with its white gown. <eos> we posed in the lighting and made memories. <eos> we left the spooky house eventually, but it was great halloween fun!
we spent a week preparing our house for halloween night. <eos> we carved the pumpkins and lit them up/ <eos> we set up the coffin and filled it with a body. <eos> the vampire couple was really scary. <eos> our house won an award for being the best one on the street.
the house's haunted decor took hours, but it looked amazing in the end.  <eos> the green light made the status appear like a walking man out of nowhere.  <eos> the ghost danced around every time the wind blew.  <eos> everyone appeared from the cemetery.  <eos> the house was the best looking one on the block. 
we turned our house into a spool fest for halloween.  <eos> we put green spotlights in our landscaping.  <eos> a ghost greeted party guests.  <eos> the frankenstien and bride were very realistic.  <eos> we were the coolest house on the block! 
jeff and dave were trying to be really spooky this halloween. <eos> they cut some nice looking jack-o-lanterns earlier in the wek. <eos> they even got a big dead mannequin and coffin for their porch. <eos> they borrowed terri's frankenstien mannequin as weel. <eos> their house was really freaky.
today me and steve went on an adventure. <eos> we come across this tent, with tables set up outside of it, instantly our interests are peeked. <eos> we step inside and can't believe our eyes, wall to wall kegs. <eos> we met jay, who introduced us to many different beers. <eos> i'm not sure if beer taste testing has the same rules as wine, but i can assure you we were not spitting out these delicious drinks!
i went to my first beer tasting today. <eos> there were many different kinds to choose from. <eos> i met a lot of great people there. <eos> i even ran into the president of the brewers' association! <eos> all in all, it was a perfect day.
our friend opened a brewery in our city.  <eos> the brewery features a variety of beers. <eos> many guests gathered to try some of the beers outside the brewery. <eos> a local newscaster visited the brewery. <eos> at the end of the day, more guests than anticipated arrived. 
my buddy and i are going to a beer festival.  <eos> we are early and not too many people are here. <eos> the tasting room is set up. <eos> they are poring right from the kegs. <eos> that is the look of happiness on my face.
the men were happy <eos> that they were at an event. <eos> they made food <eos> and were having beer <eos> that was home brewed.
today was the day jimmy would be come a super hero but he needed a costume, so he looked online for some help. <eos> he knew he needed a mask, she would start there. <eos> he added some night vision to the mask in hopes to catch the bad guys at night. <eos> there, finally finished.  <eos> "now what to call myself? hmmm i got it. "" father feather"" awesome."
"we wanted to film a ""how-to"" video to help them make a halloween mask. <eos> we set up the computer to film us. <eos> we took pictures of our supplies. we thought we looked very professional. <eos> we had trouble making sure our directions made sense, though. <eos> "we stopped when we had to explain how to sew on the feathers. we have decided that those directions are so complicated we need to write them down.
a friend sent me a video on how to make a halloween mask. <eos> he had a picture slideshow and actual video footage. <eos> one of the pictures displayed all the materials needed to make a mask. <eos> the video portion showed step by step how to assemble the mask. <eos> lastly, the final minutes of the video showed the variations of customization to the halloween mask. 
i decided to search online for ideas.  <eos> i followed the simulations on the screen.  <eos> here's the products i bought.  <eos> i'm trying to affix the screws.  <eos> the finished mask !
this is a picture of a macbook air. <eos> this is a picture of a man welding. <eos> this is a picture of a man. <eos> this is a picture of a mask. <eos> this is a photo of a black mask.

after the zombie apocalypse, ted just drives around hoping to find other people. <eos> he checks big universities in hopes of find someone left alive.  <eos> it looks like he is having no better luck here. <eos> there just seems like no one is left. this is making ted very sad. <eos> so he moves one in hopes one day he might not be so lonely.
we went to visit dave at college. <eos> it was fall, so some of the campus was decorated for the season. <eos> he showed us around campus, including the quad. <eos> there were some funny spots he knew about that he was eager to show us. <eos> it was a great visit that went by too quickly!
the man woke up early to get ready for his trip. <eos> his first stop was to check out the friendly scarecrow. <eos> then, he went to look at the gardens. <eos> he came across a gorilla and could not resist being photographed with it. <eos> he was very happy with himself!
he worried about his receding hairline.  <eos> he thought he looked like a scarecrow.  <eos> often he would duck inside buildings, or hide behind trees.  <eos> he was just so wrong for worrying about his hairline.  <eos> he is a super cute guy. 
the pumpkin was angry. <eos> someone had stolen all of his seeds. <eos> he waited patiently in front of the house for night to fall. <eos> once it was night time he made his move. <eos> he proceeded into the house to finally get his revenge. there were no survivors.
happy halloween everyone.its time to celebrate.  <eos> this is the front steps entrance to the house. <eos> here's a photo of the front of the house  <eos> i love this photo of the house lit up at night  <eos> and here's the completed photo during the day 
the family decided to decorate pumpkins for halloween. <eos> we baked the pumpkin seeds from the pumpkins we carved out so we could eat them.  <eos> the children placed a few pumpkins outside the front yard. <eos> carving a pumpkin inside a pumpkin was difficult, but it looked fascinating. <eos> we realized we scared some children away from our home. not many children stopped by to grab candy. 
the halloween decorations were pretty big and frightening.  <eos> a big dinner for holiday was about to be ready. <eos> they cared and set decorations in front of the house. <eos> one of big pumpkin fell down.  <eos> they needed to put decoration in order again. 
the jack o lantern was seen eating a little pumpkin. <eos> the seeds were being dried out to be cooked in the oven. <eos> the outside of the house with the jack o lanterns during the day. <eos> the other jack o lantern had its mouth full as well. <eos> the outside with the jack o lanterns lit up for the night.
the kids were all ready for trick or treat. <eos> when they arrived back home, they were worn out, but happy. <eos> so many candies were brought home! <eos> this was their take. <eos> he didn't reallize how much candy he had in that bag!
look how much candy i have mom! <eos> i have all this candy from tonight. <eos> i'm going to organize it as much as possible. <eos> wait, there's no point. <eos> i'm just going to eat it all by myself anyways.
the last pose before heading out for treats. <eos> i wonder where my buddy went. <eos> i got my cute little green bag filled.  <eos> it was a great night. look at all the great candy i got.  <eos> why can't i eat my candy for dinner?
i convinced my friends to go with me to the party last night. <eos> they put together their own costumes for the party. <eos> we got a lot of candy from trick or treating. <eos> we laid out all of our catch for the day. <eos> we wondered how we were going to eat all of it.
getting ready for halloween, sure to scare for some candy <eos> right after getting some loot <eos> the bag nearly filled up with the loot <eos> unloading the spoils <eos> what to do with all this candy?

our october trip to disney world in florida. <eos> some decorations like flowers were there for the season. <eos> more recently everything was decorated with jack-o-lanterns. this is where we had lunch. <eos> even the information booth was decorated. <eos> my favorite was this witch pumpkin. 
we had a halloween festival in town. <eos> there where a lot of decorations. <eos> there was a lot of jack o lanterns. <eos> the decorations where very cool. <eos> it was a fun day.
the sifewalked was painted.  <eos> the flowers were very tall and beautiful.  <eos> pumpkins rested on the balcony. <eos> it took a lot of work to get our creations on the roof. <eos> this pumpkin won the competition. 
we took a trip to the magic kingdom. <eos> disneyland presents its visitors with a an assortment of flowers. <eos> we went to tony's restaurant to recharge our energy for the day. <eos> here are 4 pumpkins that are carved with smirks on their faces. <eos> like the carving on the pumpkin, we had to fly away to our destination.
going to the magic kingdom today for halloween festival! <eos> such a beautiful view! i love it here! <eos> cute pumpkins above tony's restaurant this place is the best! <eos> look at these pumpkins with facial expressions! <eos> my favorite pumpkin of them all! the witch pumpkin!
halloween was fast approaching. <eos> the family decided to go to the great pumpkin blaze. <eos> jack-o-lanterns everywhere in beautiful and scary designs. <eos> some simple some intricate. <eos> they never saw so many pumpkins!
the stairs to this place were really set up for halloween.  <eos> some weren carved to be cute  <eos> others went for scary designs.  <eos> and some were simple enough to be done by younger children. <eos> as we left we saw this guy taking pictures with his phone. 
the lanterns lit up the dark night.  <eos> there we're several intricate lanterns. <eos> many of the lanterns showed very well at night time. <eos> my lantern was spooky and ghoulish.  <eos> i used my smartphone to take a gallery of photos.
we decided to go all out with pumpkin carving this past halloween. <eos> this was suppose to turn out to be a tree. it turned out alright! <eos> of course you have to have a basic scary face. the basic essential of all pumpkin carving designs. <eos> and you can't just have one! we really had the halloween fever last year. <eos> the fun thing about carving is the unlimited designs you can do. from basic designs to ones with one eye and a lightning bolt for the other.... i can't wait to carve again for this upcoming year.
this is the ambiance of our halloweens usually, we start out with this section with two rows of jack o'lanterns.. <eos> i'll close in on this one, what do you think this one is? <eos> this is definitely a pig. <eos> this one looks like someone shot a hole into its chin, oops! <eos> somehow my friend got in this picture with his cellphone out by the front.
this is our home in the winter. it can get a bit chilly. <eos> here's our family all bundled together. <eos> we decided to go a little ways south to get away from the cold. <eos> here's john sitting on the balcony of our hotel. <eos> here are some fountains that we found in the downtown area. aren't they pretty?
the city was vast. harold wondered how he would like this new city.  <eos> he found a pretty house in a nice neighborhood. in winter it looked like a postcard. <eos> harold discovered a river he thought he could fish in.  <eos> harold found a swing large enough for an adult.  <eos> after several months living in his new city harold knew he loved this place.
my new apartment has plenty to offer, and one of those things is a magnificent view of the city. <eos> in winter, the neighborhood has a quaint feeling that i love. <eos> and for the summer months, it's right across the street from a beautiful little park. <eos> i can act as silly as i want there. <eos> yes, i definitely found the perfect apartment for all seasons.
the city was filled with a snow base. <eos> we took a group photo in our living room. <eos> outside, the city line was amazing.  <eos> i told my friend to take a photo in front of the city. <eos> the water fountain in the city was grand. 
the view in our room was beautiful. <eos> the day after, we visited the mountains for fresh air. <eos> we hiked up the trail to stop at this lake. <eos> i had lots of fun on the swinging set. <eos> this town continues to inspire me.
here i am getting ready. <eos> now i have a shirt on. <eos> here's me with my mask. <eos> who is this pink haired lady? <eos> and why is that guy staring at me?
susan is at home getting ready for the costume party at her friend's house. <eos> she has decided to dress up in a gothic theme and has selected the perfect dress for the occasion. <eos> maggie applies makeup, including white face powder, and black lip and eye liner to really dress the part. <eos> her look is almost complete with great makeup and an added cape around her gothic dress. <eos> finally, the perfect finishing touch, a mysterious mask.
halloween is my favorite holiday. <eos> a little goth makeup, and a pretty dress start the transformation. <eos> add the mask and the transformation is complete. <eos> it's the one time of the year you can let your inner self shine through. <eos> now it's time to dance the night away.
taking a selfie before i put on my costume. <eos> the makeup is all done. <eos> it 's all coming together now that i have my cape on. <eos> i had to get one big smile. <eos> i have my serious face on now. i think the mask pulled it all together. 
today i made my makeup crazy for the masquerade ball.  <eos> i put on period victorian clothing as well.  <eos> i decorated my mask with silver lining.  <eos> i went to the ball with my best friend.  <eos> there were so many people dancing and drinking.

this halloween was so much fun seeing all the costumes that the families wore.  <eos> this little one was so cute in his home made costume that his mom made for him.  <eos> just loved seeing all the little ones in their costumes they were so ready to go out and trick or treat. <eos> that face tells the whole story about the eagerness this little one has to get started.  <eos> then we all ended the day going to the haunted house up the road. this is the best part of the day.

it was a spooky night in our neighborhood as everyone prepared for halloween festivities. <eos> our very best friends and neighbors arrived to help us get ready for the party and trick or treaters. <eos> after a quick snack we all got to work on pumpkin carving and decorations. <eos> the pumpkins came out amazing and we arranged them outside to greet the kids coming for candy. <eos> our first friend in costume arrived and it was superman. he was the first of many visitors that night!
i invited all of my friends to my house for the halloween party. <eos> everyone dressed up. <eos> we all sat and had some coffee together. <eos> afterward we got started on the jack-o-lanterns. <eos> once it got dark there were some children asking for candy.
i love decorating for halloween.  <eos> and i was thrilled that some of my friends were coming by to celebrate with me.  <eos> we had some snacks and thought about how we wanted to decorate our pumpkins.  <eos> we had a great time creating our pumpkins and putting them out on display.  <eos> then we welcomed the first of our trick or treaters. 
i know i go a little overboard for halloween. but i love dressing up. <eos> once i get started making jack-o-lanterns, i can't stop. <eos> i made my husband dress up too. he's a good sport about it. <eos> my sister laura comes over to help hand out candy, and she does it up big too. <eos> we love to see all the little dressed up kids. it's the best night of the year.
a rave party is about to start at the club. <eos> party goers from all over town show up, some in unique costumes. <eos> as more people arrive, friends are reunited and begin partying together. <eos> the lights are turned off and the party begins, with flashing and blinking strobe lights. <eos> a large turnout means lots of fun for all party goers.
as they walk up they check out the sign <eos> before the festivities he paused to take a picture. <eos> he took a picture of his best friends before the party started. <eos> they are headed out to the light show. <eos> the bright lights were quite exciting to end the night.
upon seeing the sign, everyone knew that the rave was going to be fun. <eos> he didn't know what to expect going in but found that he was having a great time. <eos> he even made a friend or two once the party started. <eos> his sister found the party props made it all seem even more exhilarating.  <eos> the lights from the rave danced along the dark lit room to create a dazzling effect as everyone danced the night away.
the rave promised to be a great party. <eos> the man was ready for an exciting night, and hoped to scare a few friends with his mask. <eos> the friends were not loosened up yet, but the night was still young! <eos> the party was filled with colors and lights. <eos> the friends crowded together to chat. the girl hoped her angel costume would be a big hit.
it is rave night at the flu room! <eos> rave night makes this guy pretty happy. peace! <eos> everyone is happier with a cocktail in hand. <eos> per-ma grin and huge glasses we do not need to tell these girls how to have a good time. <eos> pretty lights! happy people , this night is a success.
the yearly office halloween party always brings out some creative and unique costumes. <eos> everyone enjoys having the opportunity to relax from work and enjoy themselves. <eos> some employees spend months thinking of and designing their costumes. <eos> while others simply show up in another uniform for a different job! <eos> at the end of the day, much fun is had and work morale is high.
work was very fun yesterday because everyone dressed up for halloween. <eos> some people had uniforms as costumes. <eos> most people took the time to dress up nicely. <eos> there were a lot of great costume ideas. <eos> everyone had a great time.
halloween at work was always fun because of the amazing costumes people wore, like the boss as a blue fairy. <eos> sometimes, it was harder to tell what someone dressed up as. he could have been a rock star or a television character. it was fun to guess. <eos> she always dressed up as disney villains. we were excited to see who she would be next. <eos> meanwhile, others would dress up to honor our soldiers. <eos> some people even brought their children in on the fun. it was an amazing day.
halloween was not that interesting for her, so she didn't bother dressing up. <eos> she borrowed a karate costume to celebrate, and loved wearing it to work. <eos> she always wanted to be a kitty, and here was her chance! <eos> their costumes made them feel like they could be anything they wanted to be. <eos> she felt a little odd wearing a hat at work, but she'd always wanted to be a cowgirl!
halloween is just another day at the office for some people. <eos> for some people halloween is a chance to wear that kung foo suit that has been in the back of the closet for too long. <eos> it is more fun to take calls at your desk when you are a cat. <eos> let's all pose with this skinny fellow. the office girls are looking good. <eos> i want to be a cowgirl! happy halloween!!
i threw a halloween party at my house yesterday. <eos> there was a huge turnout. <eos> the party was full of people. <eos> everyone was chatting with one another. <eos> i got to meet a lot of new people.
we made our home into a haunted house for halloween.  <eos> we put a big orange sign in the front yard.  <eos> we put up a big michael meyers scarecrow in the front yard to scare everyone too.  <eos> the entrance looks really creepy and scary.  <eos> it was a huge set up and took over the whole slide of the house.
the halloween party was great, everyone came out in costume. <eos> everyone had a fun time with each others costumes. <eos> little annie and the bumble bee pose for the camera. <eos> the 70's disco look was in vogue tonight. <eos> fun times all around as everyone wants their picture taken, what a fun evening.
the party was a big hit for everyone. <eos> some guests posed for the camera, proud of their costume choices. <eos> the two friends enjoyed their outfits, especially the woman in the bee costume. <eos> the couple was thrilled to bring back the 60's, complete with fluffy afro wigs. <eos> the superhero costume made a man feel brave, as he posed with his friends.
a group photo before the halloween party <eos> she really like her bumblebee outfit <eos> everyone is dressed up for the halloween <eos> sitting on the stairs and deciding what to do later tonight <eos> she does not like his hat, but they look nice in this photo
college halloween parties allow college students to take a break from their hard work. <eos> it also lets students come up with creative (and provocative) costumes. <eos> lots of students enjoy dressing up and then seeing their friends dressed up in different costumes. <eos> they will sometimes attend a dance or party where they can dance the night away. <eos> most have so fun that they are upset when the night ends.
there were a lot of people at the halloween party last night. <eos> we had it in a basement. <eos> tons of people were there and dressed up. <eos> i had fun taking pictures with all of them. <eos> some people did not like the party.
this man and women are headed to a halloween bash. <eos> this women decided to make up her costume for the halloween bash. <eos> as these three friends get together somebody feels left out. <eos> as the girl in blue photo bombs a picture the girl with pigtails is pretending to be happy. <eos> but deep down inside she wish the girl in blue didn't photo bomb her photo.
everyone started showing up for the halloween party.  <eos> more people showed up than what was expected!  <eos> they all stopped to pose for goofy photos.  <eos> many of the costumes showed a lot of skin, of course.  <eos> and then there were intricate costumes like this one. 
at the halloween party, my friends were dressed up as two people on a boat. <eos> my other friend had her costume on that she thought she would not fit into. <eos> my two friends got a picture with a guy wearing a skeleton mask and shirt. <eos> the party was a hit and everyone enjoyed each others company. <eos> my friend was upset that her costume was shown up by many other people.
last week we had a pizza party for the class for halloween. <eos> i let all of the kids dress up for the day. <eos> everyone brought some very unique costumes. <eos> all of the children had a great time. <eos> i made sure to dress up as well.

halloween is my favorite time of year. <eos> i always put a lot of effort into make my home extra spooky during halloween. <eos> i don't turn on many lights. <eos> i take time to make a lot of home-made decorations. <eos> i take lots of pictures as well.
this house was made into a haunted house.  <eos> the rooms were lit to be spooky. <eos> headless mannequins were dressed and dimly lit. <eos> if you make it all the way through the haunted house there are snacks. <eos> each person gets a popcorn hand to take home. 
halloween was a special time at the house.  <eos> the house was fully decorated.  <eos> the decor was very creepy.  <eos> lots of fun snacks were waiting for the guests.  <eos> the combination of the decor and the treats made this a memorable halloween season. 
did i ever tell you about this chair? <eos> that chair (like this one) is haunted! <eos> if anyone puts their chair in front of this particular light... <eos> their hand will become like this! <eos> this woman is living proof!
the perfect location was chosen for the halloween party.  <eos> the inside lighting was also perfect and sinister.  <eos> everything was set up perfectly, even the coat racks.  <eos> the food and decoration stayed on theme.  <eos> and even looked completely horrific at times. 
on our disney family vacation last year we attended the mickey's very merry christmas party. <eos> the costumes were really done well. <eos> disney gives a lot of candy. <eos> the halloween parade is professionally done. <eos> even mickey gets into the spirit.

"fans of anime and video games sometimes like to dress up like their favorite characters. <eos> this type of fandom is called ""cos-play"". <eos> costumes can be very ornate and expensive. <eos> they enjoy dressing up and then acting like their favorite characters. <eos> "a lot of fans will have multiple costumes for different characters.
last week i finally had a chance to wear my new costume. <eos> there was a cosplay convention not far from my home. <eos> i figured this would be the best time to show off my new costume. <eos> i dressed up and got ready for the event. <eos> i brought my sword just in case.
matt loved cosplay. this is where you invent a character and make a costume to develop it.  <eos> he was particularly proud of the design and construction of the hilt of his sword. it was very elaborate.  <eos> his cape and tunic he had made the pattern and sewn it himself.  <eos> he knew had done good work.  <eos> matt was ready for the next cosplay event. 
he had been practicing all year for the annual role playing tournament. <eos> his outfit this year was far better than in years past. <eos> plus, his sword was something everyone would be jealous of. <eos> he had even worked on his swordsmanship throughout the year to impress all the ladies. <eos> he couldn't wait to head out so he could show off all his new skills.
my little brother wanted to be some kind of character from an anime for halloween. <eos> he like how real the blade of his sword looked. <eos> he pretended to fight a foe! <eos> he hacked at his imaginary enemy. <eos> after he finished pretend fighting, he stood triumphantly!

the children were all dressed up and ready to go trick o treating and to a friends halloween party soon after. <eos> the kids were having a blast at the halloween party. <eos> the kids went trick o treating for a little while, while the party carried on. <eos> the kids decided to go back to the halloween party for more fun. <eos> the kids partied at the halloween party until they were full of candy and ready to go home.
needed to stop and get gas before continuing on. <eos> a lovely small town that is a good place to call home. <eos> we are finally here, what natural beauty. <eos> another beautiful spot we found while exploring. <eos> what a gorgeous place for a picnic in the beauty of nature.
despite enjoying the field trip, the day was quite exhausting. we explored different areas, <eos> from native habitats to modern caves. <eos> the bus ride home was quite boring, considering that i wasn't able to see any interesting from the bus window. <eos> i did come across this funny poster though. <eos> when i arrived home, i did the honor of taking out some cold refreshments.
gas stations are not intended to be called home, but sometimes it can be seen that way. <eos> when you live on the road, it's almost like you live everywhere. sometimes that feeling is quite overwhelming. <eos> however, there are certain rewards to living on the road. <eos> each day is a new day filled with new sights and excitement. <eos> each sight is unique and reminds us that tomorrow will be just as exciting.
the scene from inside the cave <eos> inside the cave was unique and cold. <eos> i enjoyed this vintage sign. <eos> the sign that reminds we are home <eos> after our vacation a treat at home.
we took a trip to the cave to see what all the hype was about. <eos> the stairs leading down the cave took 10 minutes to walk.  <eos> there was a motel next to the cave that we stayed at. <eos> my husband thought this welcome mat was very... welcoming. <eos> chilled beers were a great way to end our trip. 
fido is a little nervous since the humans seem to be behaving a little strangely.  <eos> fido has never seen a group with masks and shields and swords. <eos> he is even more nervous as he observes a really tall biped with an ugly face. the hot blond does little to settle fido's nerves. <eos> fido is frozen. he doesn't quite feel fear, but he is sure anxious. <eos> finally he begins to relax because he sees these humans with regular faces and they are smiling.
the costume party we went to was great! <eos> there was a group who dressed as ninja turtles. <eos> one guy came as austin powers. <eos> there were tons of fairies and princesses at the party. <eos> everyone had fun partying and drinking.
i've always felt like halloween should be for kids, but a guy at my work invited me to his adult halloween party this year. <eos> i was truly surprised how much people did it up. i can't imagine adults making ninja turtle costumes. <eos> my friend did an austin powers thing. he said it made all the woman randy. <eos> i have to admit it was fun seeing women in their costumes. <eos> and there was a good deal of beer flowing freely, which made me a little more into the whole thing!
i hosted a halloween party at my town house and toto loved it. <eos> the delousa family dressed up as ninjas.  <eos> a guy with a skull mask showed up.  <eos> toto was curious as to why so many strange creatures were at our town house.  <eos> the end of the night called for a costume contest. 
the dog wasn't prepared for what was about to happen that night. <eos> there were giant turtles everywhere! <eos> horrible monsters and cute princesses. the house was full of weirdness. <eos> what surprised him the most though was seeing alice. <eos> yes, that alice. the one from wonderland.
i talked my brother into having a halloween party this year. <eos> judy, his wife dressed as a princess. <eos> one just came as a cowgirl. <eos> another guest dressed like a fairy. <eos> by the end of the evening there were many people there.
everyone was excited to be heading to the halloween party.  <eos> everyone was decked out in halloween outfits.  <eos> i really loved the cool outfits that everyone had come up with.  <eos> i met up with some of my friends and we had a great time talking. <eos> the entire party was awesome, i'm glad i had the chance to go. 
my name is tom, and i'm testing my black and white camera for the school halloween party. <eos> here's daisy in her costume. <eos> and jackie came with her friends. <eos> sue went as little bo peep. <eos> everyone had a great time, and so did i.
last nights halloween parts was crazy! <eos> there were rockstars, <eos> princesses in beautiful gowns,  <eos> even a cowgirl in a cool hat. <eos> everyone was on lsd and things got weird.
i was planning on celebrating halloween alone at a local diner. <eos> then, a cute girl in costume invited me to her party. <eos> there, she introduced me to a bunch of dressed-up women. <eos> i liked the sugar plum fairy! <eos> there was a big turnout, and i was glad i hadn't just sat alone in the diner.
i finally arrived at my friend's halloween party. <eos> everyone was already there and it seemed i was late. <eos> we had many drinks that night. <eos> people were starting to get drunk. <eos> i, myself, was feeling tipsy and decided to take a seat.
the couple was putting the finishing touches on their costumes. <eos> the girl needed a little bit more done on hers. <eos> the man was helping her with her costume. <eos> he helped her put some more paint on. <eos> they were finally all ready to go.
taking pictures of people at the party , <eos> friends play around with there costumes <eos> and play around while taking the pictures <eos> then more pictures are taken while they play around and <eos> now the last one of someone else playing around with the girl and her costume 
when i finished my costume it did not look very impressive. <eos> my friend's costume was much better. <eos> she was showing off. <eos> i decided to teach her a lesson. <eos> i changed my costume and then we went to the party together.
halloween costumes--even bad ones--were required for the party. <eos> as always, people congregated around the drinks.  <eos> in fact, drinking cheap beer was the main event of the night. <eos> it made everyone's costumes seem cooler. <eos> i'm sure i'll feel great tomorrow morning!
some of the simplest costumes were the most creative.  <eos> a lot of people showed up for the party.  <eos> some costumes were very scary.  <eos> with drinks in hand, there was plenty of conversations going. <eos> one group of guests had a little skit going. 
the party had some unique characters. <eos> the ladies had a great time. <eos> so did the office worker clown. <eos> the party was really fun. <eos> we did the robot dance.
i decided to throw a halloween party this year, and this was my boyfriends costume.  <eos> my friends certainly did not disappoint with their costumes either.  <eos> i think he is trying to be more than one individual with this costume.  <eos> we have a real life rockstar at the party, so my sister decided to take a picture with him.  <eos> my sister seems to be attracted to all of the stars. 
my friends have a great sense of humor. <eos> they dressed crazy for the halloween party. <eos> one looked like a doctor clown. <eos> one of my friends made a very convincing slash. <eos> several went as cross-dressers.
here is the 404 man posing for the camera. <eos> a man with a red nose is smiling for the camera. <eos> the man and woman are smiling while dressed in costume. <eos> the man and woman are smiling for the camera at the party. <eos> the man is filming the party while the crowd looks on.
the friends went on a night time zombie walk. <eos> they dressed up and used makeup. <eos> everyone made themselves look very scary. <eos> then they walked slowly through the streets. <eos> they scared a lot of people.
all the boys gathered to go out that night.  <eos> there was a big party at he local club. <eos> a lot of people were starting to show up.  <eos> most were dressed for the holiday.  <eos> the line was getting long to get in.
there were a lot of zombies on the road today. <eos> i did my best to avoid them. <eos> they were very close at one point. <eos> there were too many of them so i got on my bike and rode away. <eos> i rode as fast as i could.
the boys arrive at the halloween party early. <eos> they set off to enact their master plan of stealing all the punch. <eos> little do they know, claire is way ahead of them. <eos> all at once, she shuts off all the lights and grabs her car! <eos> these boys will be getting a ride in the trunk back to the punch police station.
the guy with the eye patch had a great costume <eos> everyone wanted to take a photo of him. <eos> there were many good costumes overall <eos> and there was dancing at night <eos> all night long.
the children were joined by their parents on the first day of class. <eos> the children were urged to try new activities on their own. <eos> there were tons of things for the kids to do. <eos> one young girl had a great time on the train. <eos> she had a great day on her first day of class!
a fun day of arts and crafts at pre-school. <eos> so many things for the children to play with at school, so much to pick from. <eos> learning balance and coordination while having fun at schoo. <eos> parents with their children while they become adjusted to school. <eos> a parent having a chat with the teacher at school.
we attended a kid's play date at which the children were initially wary of each other. <eos> i think once the adults detached themselves from their kids, the kids felt better about exploring.  <eos> kate first tentatively tried playing with some educational toys set on a table.  <eos> but she quickly moved onto the more mobile toys, like the train ride. <eos> she willingly gave the camera a smile when i asked. 
the first day of preschool was very exciting. <eos> all the moms and dads stayed to help the kids settle in. <eos> my daughter found some great games to play with. <eos> she loved the train that she could ride around the room. <eos> she had so much fun, she can't wait for tomorrow's class.
we've been visiting preschools for weeks now, looking for the right one for our little ava. <eos> i have to say, i was fairly impressed with miss laura's play preschool. <eos> there were a huge amount of educational toys, all well kept and clean. <eos> ava adored the train you could ride around the room. <eos> i loved the big smile on ava's face when i told her she'd be going to miss laura's for preschool next year!
inside this spooky house, important business is happening.  <eos> all these pumpkins shall be transformed into jack o'lanterns. <eos> the family takes their task very seriously. <eos> first a face is drawn on the pumpkin then a sharp knife is used to carve the face out.  <eos> a candle is placed inside and the pumpkin will glow for hours.

we love costume parties and love to have them at our home because it is our favorite holiday. <eos> we get a kick out of all the different ideas our family/friends come up with for costumes and alien costumes are no exception. <eos> some come up with the most unique ideas and it does not cost a lot of money because she used a paper bowl for a hat and transformed herself into what i think is a clown. <eos> scary costumes are great and a vodoo mask is always welcome and i really liked this one. <eos> i did not even recognize my friend in this costume when i first saw him because he looked so different and scary which makes it a lot of fun.

"our local bar threw their annual halloween party last weekend.  <eos> it was fun, a lot of drunks wearing rubber masks. pretty much standard.  <eos> ralph seemed to be a big target for the drunk masked people, but he kept smiling.  <eos> but things got kinda weird when they announced their own version of ""coyote ugly"" was going to take place.  <eos> "and so a lot of the waitresses and some of the patrons jumped up on the bar and danced. it was pretty wild.

looks like halloween reporting has the got the best of me. <eos> do i really look happy? <eos> this scare crow would make the corn field cry!  <eos> i'm in love with the clown. <eos> cool dude, how about a little purple.
remember when halloween was scary monsters and stuff? well evidently no one at bill and steph's party did.  <eos> i spent most of the night trying to figure out what frank was supposed to be.  <eos> and rick as a really politically incorrect pimp...that was just sad.  <eos> tom had a pretty accurate army costume, because it was his actual bdu.  <eos> well at least phil was scary, since i hate clowns. but linda still doesn't get what dressing up means. 
when i got to the party everyone was already there. <eos> there were many different kinds of costumes. one was made out of paper. <eos> some were very flashy. <eos> others were wearing their work uniforms. <eos> some people forgot and thought it was a birthday party.
i hate halloween parties. <eos> everyone is dressed up with weird hair. <eos> others try to scare you, but they just look stupid. <eos> the clowns are kinda creepy. <eos> the most bizarre was my friend trying to be a pimp.
a harvard student wore his exams to the party  <eos> with a guy with rainbow hair. <eos> jason also made an appearance <eos> to save the girl from the clown. <eos> the pimp was the coolest guy of all.
the kids dress up for the halloween party. this little tot is a spooky ghost! <eos> some of the costumes are creepy and some are as favorite movie characters such as darth vader. <eos> too much partying has put this little guy to sleep! <eos> after waking up, it looks like maybe he's ready for some candy! <eos> halloween is a favorite holiday for the entire family.

we arrived late at the party and it wasn't by accident. <eos> i wasn't looking forward to another boring gathering. <eos> but a croquet game started and it was really fun. <eos> i hadn't played since i was a kid but i did pretty well. <eos> i'll happily attend more family functions if games are played.
community run by the community center to start.it was a great turn out and amazing to see so many people participate.i don't know how they do it.i'd literally die running a mile. <eos> men and women from all walks of life, large and small. <eos> one mile marker..wow look at that stride. <eos> i'm not sure of the actual distance run or who was first through the finish line.but the picture i took was at 35:32.running that long is a work out i think. <eos> many people coming in still after 35 minutes of running.they all gave it a good try and did really well.
we had a 5k race for charity <eos> lots of kids took interest and it was a success <eos> at the first mile people started to get tired  <eos> some girls kept going  <eos> they made it to the end 
we're getting ready to start the big race! my wife and i run this race yearly for charity.  <eos> off we go! <eos> this is the one mile marker.....not much more to go! <eos> there's my wife tied for the lead! <eos> my wife finished 2nd! congrats debbie!
steve signed up for the local marathon. <eos> he had a great start and was leading the crowd. <eos> by the time he reached the one mile mark he noticed no competition. <eos> in fact most of the runners were struggling far behind. <eos> it took them 35 minutes to even reach the one mile mark.
everyone lines up before the race starts. <eos> the gun goes off and everyone starts running. <eos> at the one mile mark we have lost half of the runners. <eos> at the end of the race people started showing up. <eos> one after another, people made some good time!
there was many things of diplay <eos> from shirts to signed memorabilia  <eos> a lot of different and interesting documents <eos> this museum showed off many great treasures <eos> it would be an honor to see these masterpieces

the national newspaper museum contains a great many famous articles.  <eos> this includes pieces written from the start of wwii. <eos> famous writings from many historical periods make up the collection. <eos> a visitor is invited to view and read these pieces as they originally appeared. <eos> it is a worthy destination for any lover of history or newspapers.
i had a great time at the picnic last week. <eos> there were a lot of people there. <eos> the children had a great time. <eos> we told them stories. <eos> some of the stories were very scary.
today was a special day for some local kids. they would get to meet some football players from the local team and see a play. <eos> parents and kids alike were eager to meet their favorite football players as they lined up for autographs and pictures. <eos> the football players were really nice to the kids and took the time to sign autographs for all of them, including pictures as well. <eos> afterward, the kids got to watch a funny play including the mascot and some local comedians. <eos> after the play, children got to take pictures with the comedians and the mascot. it was a great day for everyone.
many came out to support the program, including many future footballers. <eos> donations were coming in fast and the booth stayed busy. <eos> including taking this 10,000 dollar check from alex smith. <eos> which, lead to coach palmer shouting to the rooftops... <eos> and, the cardinal mascot chasing his daughter down for a celebratory hug!
the family took the kids to a summer camp. <eos> they learned more about the camp when they arrived. <eos> they signed the kids up for the camp for the day. <eos> the kids had fun listening to the camp leader talk. <eos> at the end of the day the kids got to meet the camps mascot.
the family was all helping out <eos> at the event. <eos> there were giant fingers <eos> and kids were cheering  <eos> at the old man.
they pulled up at the field ready for the big game. <eos> it was crowded and hard to tell what was going on. <eos> fortunately the announcer was on top of keeping the crowd informed. <eos> the end of the game was celebrated with a small community concert. <eos> then the community enjoyed the beautiful sunset over their small town.
jason had the brilliant idea of holding an improptu concert at his home. <eos> he needed a stage so he called his friend to bring him his truck with the towing platform. <eos> it was the perfect size for the band. <eos> the band played all night long for the guests. <eos> as the sun went down, the band continued playing to the joy of others.
one white car and one blue car. <eos> alot of people in football fields. <eos> person watching football in room. <eos> person play guitar outside home. <eos> tree at night times.
it's a big day in the town of tide alabama.  <eos> the local football team is in the championship.  <eos> the announcer has a live feed going to a local radio station.  <eos> many people are having parties at home to celebrate.  <eos> after winning the game, everyone settled down for a nice evening under the stars.
everyone was getting ready for the after game party.  <eos> the football game was so exciting, the home team won.  <eos> john had so much fun announcing the game.  <eos> after the game, all the players headed to the captain's house.  <eos> after such a great game, it was fun to watch the sun set. 
it was a college basketball game <eos> the basketball player slammed dunked the ball during warm ups <eos> the band played their team on <eos> and met with the announcers <eos> of course the cheerleaders lead their way as well 
the basketball game was a lot of fun yesterday. <eos> i brought the entire family with me. <eos> we all had a great time. <eos> the mascot was very entertaining. <eos> the band also played music for everyone.
here to watch the game and scream to support my team. <eos> the 1st dunk of the game, looking good. <eos> the band is playing their little hearts out. <eos> shaking hands is a big part of the game. <eos> the cheerleaders are really pretty girls.
it seemed that everyone had come to see darius perform for the halftime show, including tim and jane. <eos> and, their little brother and mother! <eos> and, the mean girls of chestnut night school even came out to support darius. <eos> and, then he took of, leaping over the cardinal mascot and slammed the ball home. <eos> and, the band celebrated certain victory for darius in the slam dunk contest!
our high school team made it to the championship. <eos> fans from every age group attended. <eos> these girls are dating some of the players. <eos> the game winning slam dunk was made by our best player. <eos> i almost joined the band this year. now i wish i had.
the military museum included a lot of memorabilia. <eos> from wars spanning decades. <eos> and weapons used in all those wars. <eos> the front yard had replicas of tanks. <eos> and the roof held a replica helicopter.
this was a war memorial  <eos> it was dedicated to fallen soldiers  <eos> many fallen were honored here <eos> and many guns were on display <eos> it's a great place to visit and pay tribute 
the local armory is now part museum. it houses old cannons and relics from previous wars. <eos> inside, there are pictures of more modern combat. <eos> it also houses many guns and weapons, to show the technological advancement. <eos> usually, it is very quiet outside. <eos> but you can always find at least one or two veterans who return and sit outside, just remember their days at war.
this cannon is displayed outside a war museum. <eos> the exhibits include soldiers carefully entering a building. <eos> these are some weapons used to fight battles over the years. <eos> tanks from old wars are lined up outside. <eos> there is even a helicopter on display on the roof.
the war museum was neat. <eos> they had exhibits. <eos> many guns were on display. <eos> the outdoor area was nicely designed. <eos> the helicopter is the highlight of the museum.
our high school marching band looked sharp in the parade. <eos> the night before they had to recruit a football player to fill in at trumpet at half time. <eos> he was so good, they gave him a regular uniform for the parade. <eos> the sophomores had an interesting float promoting crayons instead of pencils for class work. <eos> one of the teachers did not appreciate this idea and threw erasers at the float.
the school band was ready for the parade. <eos> although they had often performed at football games, they had never marched in a parade before. <eos> most of the band members were upset they were behind the cheerleaders in the line up. <eos> but they still gave their best effort. <eos> most people in the crowd were not impressed.
today we went to go support my school's marching band. <eos> this is a photo of them standing and getting ready. <eos> they are preparing to walk down the street for the parade. <eos> they are walking down the street with all the other floats and teams. <eos> a lot of friends and family came out to support the marching band. 
the marching band marched in the parade. <eos> they began to play their instruments. <eos> when the parade began they marched along with the floats. <eos> the student body even had it's own float. <eos> all of their friends and family was there to cheer them on.
my son, troy, is part of a fantastic high school. <eos> the football program is top notch. <eos> the marching band cannot be reckoned with by competitors. <eos> a parade happens every week. <eos> roy is a proud teacher at troy's high school. 
it was an important game day at perdue. <eos> the crowd was excited. <eos> everyone stood up during the national anthem. <eos> when the anthem was over everyone cheered. <eos> perdue university has a vibrant football culture. 
we went to see the fireworks last weekend. <eos> i love fireworks. <eos> there were many different kinds filling the night sky. <eos> i liked the multi colored ones. <eos> the closeups look very pretty.
the big game was scheduled for today. <eos> as we walked toward the entrance we saw the marching band lining up outside. <eos> the college was enormous with huge columns flanking the doors. <eos> they showed alot of school pride. <eos> we sat just in the nick of time to see the opening ceremony!
got to enjoy a purdue football game with extras. <eos> here is the band,they are huge and very good at what they do. <eos> these were the singers who sang during the band performance. <eos> lovely, they spelled out purdue! <eos> got to see the world's largest drum too.
my uncle jack made us go to the purdue game saturday.  <eos> he went to purdue and he thinks they are great...no matter what else anyone thinks.  <eos> we all had to sit in the bleachers and wear some ridiculous brown coats.  <eos> the game was good. but none of us except him are purdue fans.  <eos> he really thought it was a big deal to hit the world's largest drum. poor guy. 
i had a great time at the high school ball game yesterday. <eos> there were many cheerleaders there. <eos> their routine was very good. <eos> there were a lot of ceremonies afterward. <eos> the game was very close.
our beautiful daughter and her boyfriend, are king and queen. <eos> our awesome cheerleading squad. <eos> a wonderful game, we won! <eos> cheerleaders being presented with a spirit stick. <eos> our state champion marching band awesome job guys!

our daughter was voted homecoming queen this year. <eos> she's a star cheerleader and very athletic. <eos> my daughter is very popular with the whole squad. <eos> even the marching band loves her. practice makes perfect, kids! <eos> the team quarterback was voted king. he finally asked my daughter for a date.
high school football---what is more american than that? my older daughter was the football queen last year! <eos> she's a cheerleader, and i'm very proud of her. <eos> they work just as hard as the football players. <eos> my younger daughter is one of the flag team. <eos> and my son is one of the players. you bet i'm out there every friday night!
the three best friends stand together for a photo right before their prom. <eos> one of the girls dates surprises her with some flowers. <eos> the other girl examines the corsage that her date brought her, as she is afraid it doesn't match her dress. <eos> as it turns out, she doesn't really care, as long as she's with the one she cares about. <eos> the group then posed for one last photo before they head off to their first, and possibly last, prom. 
senior prom is one of those days you remember forever. <eos> my friends were so beautiful when they were all dressed up. <eos> and my date was handsome too. <eos> we all promised we'd be friends forever. <eos> this was one last night together, before we all went our separate ways. 
the prom is here and everyone looks great. <eos> the couples are getting ready to go off and have a fun night. <eos> corsages are being given out by the gentlemen. <eos> what a nice pair these two make. <eos> one last photo before driving off to the last night of being a high schooler.
although i can't wait for the school year to finish, i'm looking forward to the prom. <eos> my friends looked cute with their prom dates, <eos> especially my date who just arrived. <eos> i never knew we can become photogenic within one day. <eos> before we went to the hotel, all of us got together for a picture.
the woman was so happy  <eos> that she took photos with her ladies. <eos> the man liked his flowers <eos> and secrets were going around <eos> before the final set of pictures.
this guy was in the groove, he couldn't stay still! <eos> the crowd was so into it, he made sure to face the mic our way so we could be heard as well! <eos> i was so close to the stage, i was practically face to face with the singers. <eos> and when he wasn't singing, he was jamming on the guitar. <eos> this was such an awesome concert, i'd see it again!
we were there to watch him. <eos> he was on the court. <eos> it was good to be honored. <eos> it was a cold night. <eos> they are the cutest couple.
this concert was really fun! <eos> there were a lot of people there and the performers even got the crowd involved. <eos> the performers themselves were very talented <eos> and really got people excited for the party. <eos> at the end of the day, we all had fun singing, dancing and making memories.
this is a singer known as bad rad.  <eos> the back up singer and bad rad have been friends since childhood.  <eos> bad rad started the group when they were in their late teens.  <eos> he also plays lead guitar for the group.  <eos> at the end bad rad raises his arms in solidarity with his many fans. 
man dancing to the ground.  <eos> letting a fan sing in the mic.  <eos> singer singing to the crowd.  <eos> musicians playing their guitars.  <eos> thanking his fans for their support. 
the annual homecoming celebration at the local high school went really well. <eos> a lot of people were honored in front of a big crowd. <eos> kids walked on the field as their parents accompanied them.  <eos> the king and queen were crowned. it was cool to watch. <eos> they took a nice picture together with their tiara and crown on respectively. congrats you two!
i was so glad to attend the graduation ceremony. <eos> many of the students were happy to finally graduate. <eos> all of the students brought their friends and family to support them. <eos> i took plenty of pictures while i was there. <eos> i had a great time.
mom and dad are so proud of their baby girl. <eos> all the siblings were asked to get together and take a picture. <eos> even mom got a great shot of her son here. <eos> all the friends got together and shared in on the fun. <eos> king and queen they are crowned.
today was the home coming game at my daughter's high school. <eos> a lot of her friends were jealous that she was in the running from home coming queen. <eos> this young man was also in the running but no one thought he would win. <eos> alas, another girl won home coming queen that night <eos> as you can see, the homecoming court were elated.
the parents walked her out to the field for the home coming celebration. <eos> then other students walked out to the field. <eos> the teachers walked out with some of the other students. <eos> after that they presented the home coming king and queen with their crowns. <eos> they were so excited to receive the honor.
everyone was pumped up for the speech today, including myself. <eos> although there were not many guests, it didn't interfere with the event. <eos> pamela became the first guest speaker and she expressed the importance of drug awareness. <eos> i didn't bother to make a joke or anything since her speech made be breathless. <eos> afterwards, everyone enjoyed a great lunch.
a church was an odd place for this particular gathering. <eos> but the horchata championships needed someplace to have their event. <eos> hundreds of entrants usually showed up. <eos> paul wu gave out his secret recipe. <eos> jane elderberry told the attendees about new gm horschata.
before the church convention begins, some of the members clown around. <eos> one of the speakers walks up the podium. <eos> another church member makes the announcements. <eos> two members listen intently to the service. <eos> after the service is over, the congregation has refreshments.
we decided to have an event at the church so we had a chance to meet and get to know new members. <eos> some of us arrived early to prepare. <eos> our friend gave a speech about what the church meant to her. <eos> a couple of new members listened intently. <eos> we had refreshments to serve after the services.
the church council gathered to hear about the missionary reports.  <eos> it was an informal gathering as everyone sat in the sanctuary to hear the speakers.  <eos> the head missionary told stories of successful work and happy children on their travels.  <eos> the council listened and took notes.  <eos> a luncheon with foods from the trip were served for the council. 
the women's basketball game was today. <eos> the team members were seen on the campus before the game. <eos> everyone got into their uniforms to play. <eos> after the game two of the players were seen shaking hands. <eos> spokane ended up winning the game.
here is a ticket we saved from the 2011 ncaa division i women's basketball championship played at spokane arena on march 28, 2011. <eos> here is a picture of some of the women players getting fired up before the game. <eos> the game was covered by espn so it was a big deal for women's basketball. <eos> you can see the good sportsmanship being shown between the two teams right before tip off. <eos> the thrill of victory is savored by the winners as one by one they climb the ladder to each take turns cutting down the net as is tradition.
the boss gave the company tickets to see the women's basketball ncaa game. <eos> after heading out with a few workers to the game, we saw a few of the girls that were going to be playing at the game. <eos> the place was crowded, but the seats we had gave us a great view of the game. <eos> at the end of the game, two opposing players greeted one another with a handshake. <eos> the home town won the game. we were surprised by how close the game was in points. 
today is the big game. <eos> the players are getting ready. <eos> the crowd is ready for the game. <eos> the players are greeting each other. <eos> the winning team is taking down the net and that ends the game and the day.
it was exciting to have our first ticket for the championship. <eos> we even got a glimpse of the team as they were walking towards the arena. <eos> before the game the team members gathered in front of the locker rooms. <eos> on the court, the captain of each team shook hands. <eos> it was a great game, with the home team maintaining their wins.
this guy got up in the morning and made breakfast. <eos> he drove to school and sat through traffic. <eos> gas was pretty average that day, so he stopped and filled up his tank. <eos> he got to school and got his books for his classes. <eos> he studied throughout the day, making sure to finish his homework.
time to start the day. <eos> first i get dressed. <eos> next there is laundry to be done. <eos> i can't forget to make dinner. <eos> sigh... i think it's time for a nap.
mom was getting ready for her night. <eos> she buttoned up her jeans and got to work. <eos> staring at the laundry made her dizzy. <eos> the dinner was in the oven. <eos> mom passed out and dad took dinner out of the oven.
a typical day for my son. he helps with breakfast. <eos> i let him drive because he just got his license and needs the practice. <eos> i think we'll wait on filling up and see if the gas price goes down. <eos> the halls are a busy place before classes. <eos> the kids get a break to read during the day before heading home to do homework.
a woman documented some of her typical routines. <eos> she got dressed in normal clothes. <eos> the woman did laundry, carefully washing clothes of similar colors. <eos> she baked lasagna in a white dish in an electric oven. <eos> she concluded her day by tiredly falling asleep.
the tigers got the tip off at the beginning of the game. <eos> but soon the bears took over. <eos> one fan slipped on the floor but was helped by the mascot as the cheerleaders looked on. <eos> the bears continued to lead the game. <eos> all the way until the final shot. 99-60.
it was the last game of the year. <eos> the rivalry between the two teams was intense. <eos> both teams were evenly matched. <eos> but when davis saw an opportunity, they took it. <eos> and scored the winning point of the game. 
the game was getting very close. <eos> both teams were playing a good game. <eos> she put on a little show during half time. <eos> he was one of the best players of the game <eos> he made the winning shot.
the kids grabbed made up's when they jumped for the ball. <eos> the hoop stars made some crazy moves. <eos> a fan fell from the top deck and died. the janitor bear cleaned up the mess. <eos> the game went on and this dude shot like crazy. <eos> he dipped, ducked, dived, and dodged.
the pre-game antics were very amusing.  <eos> the team bear was very funny.  <eos> the 2 star player squared off as the game began.  <eos> steve smart took off on a run.  <eos> he scored the game winning basket. 
time for a soccer game, but first a burrito! <eos> my favorite team was warming up. <eos> stands were filling up, the game was about to begin.  <eos> our best player and captain. <eos> the jump for the ball. it was a fun game. 
the girls bought pizza from the concession stand.  <eos> all they guys were hungry too.  <eos> the soccer team lined the field for the national anthem.  <eos> it was a close game.  <eos> many of the spectators got up out of their seats to cheer their team to victory. 
the players interviewed before the game. <eos> then they walked out onto the field. <eos> the crowd gathered in the bleachers. <eos> the game began with an epic shot. <eos> it was a close game and an awesome night.
i'm getting ready for the soccer match by loading up on a few snacks beforehand. <eos> the teams are being introduced and you can feel the excitement building. <eos> fans are getting aroused and are pulling hard for their team. <eos> the player has gotten free for a one on one with the goalie. <eos> action is intense as the teams battle hard.
everyone cooked out before the game.  <eos> the soccer players lined up to be introduced.  <eos> the fans cheered from the sideline.  <eos> he got ready to take the shot.  <eos> the game was very intense until the end. 
re-enactors show their costumes at a local homestead. <eos> they have livestock just like real homesteaders did! <eos> the house is an old restored cabin from the 19th century. <eos> they also display cattle roping talents like the cowboys did in the days of old. <eos> but this young girl is more interested in climbing trees than roping cattle.
while at the park i stood in front of a sign that said beware of alligators and snakes. <eos> standing in front of the of the home to show off our newly cut grass and polished exterior on our home. <eos> deer heads on the wall are a collection made to show off my love of hunting. <eos> the family standing in back of the wooden balcony happily enjoying vacation time.  <eos> the husband and wife are standing in between a tree they find amusing because of its shape.
my husband doesn't take caution signs seriously, it may someday come back to bite him. <eos> we made sure to visit some historic homes on our vacation to the south. <eos> one house in particular had a large display of hunting trophies, kinda creepy. <eos> although a lot of historic homes in the southern us had amazing porches to look over farmlands. <eos> we couldn't resist taking a photo in the near by walnut tree, it was massive.
the family went and visited an old ranch in the south. <eos> they saw animals on the ranch that the ranchers take care of. <eos> the ranchers lived in small houses and they even got to go inside a big plantation home. <eos> the ranchers showed off their talents at cattle roping. <eos> the little girl even got to climb a big oak tree.
the family had to be careful on their vacation! <eos> mom posed in front of the house. <eos> one room was full of stuffed animals. <eos> dad and the kids looked at the view from above. <eos> mom and dad cozied up in a tree.
this year we took a family vacation to the lake. <eos> our vacation home was a scenic home built right on the water! <eos> we spent lots of time down on the lake shore swimming and fishing. <eos> we even found the ruins of an old home <eos> on the last day we took a canoe trip on the lake! it was a great vacation.
jeff and his new bride prefer vacations with some adventure. they chose this bed and breakfast as the launching point for this trip. <eos> as they pose for pictures, they both look toward their destination <eos> now that they are underway, they paddle to assist in their down river trip. <eos> after several hours of boating, the find a spot on the shore to spend the night. <eos> jeff has unloaded the grill from the boat and a tasty dinner will soon meet some hearty appetites. their first evening of vacation was close to perfect.
check out our new vacation house by the lake. <eos> it has a great view of the water. <eos> we can go out in our boat and travel around. <eos> then park over by the shore to do some fishing. <eos> it is nice to have a bbq at the end of the day.
our family vacation at our old lake house was a lot of fun. <eos> my boyfriend and i spent a lot of time together doing many things.  <eos> i really enjoyed riding in the canoe.  <eos> i was getting hungry and wanted to go back to the house.  <eos> dad must have been reading my mind and had something ready to eat. 
our honeymoon was a little bit different.  <eos> we rented this isolated cabin home in beautiful country wilderness. <eos> it was lake front property, with no neighbors in sight except for creatures of nature. <eos> we took a long walk and found a deserted kiln. we had a picnic there. <eos> that's us paddling in the lake. two weeks of peace and quiet and love. it was bliss!
the tourists took a day trip to the house of seven gables, a historic landmark. <eos> they got to see an old fashioned well that is on the property. <eos> the property is located right on the banks of the gorgeous bay. <eos> there are lots of historic landmarks throughout the property. <eos> as you can see, these buildings are very old. this is nathaniel hawthorne's birth house and was built in 1750!
the walking tour took us to this famous location in salem. <eos> we went to salem, mass to tour the historical houses. <eos> it was all her idea really.  <eos> and other important sites. <eos> i had a nice view of the water. but there were no boats to rent. 
in salem, massachusetts, history is still alive. <eos> i told my husband he didn't need any more wishes, i was his dream come true. of course he laughed. <eos> this is me pretending i'm not freezing out here. salem gets a little chilly in the winter. <eos> i'm so glad they were able to save this beautiful house. <eos> even in winter, the harbor is quite beautiful.
the couple visited the house of the seven gables. <eos> there were all kinds of neat things there like this well. <eos> there was a beautiful view of the dock. <eos> you could even take a tour of the property if you were willing to pay. <eos> it was a nice place with a great deal of history. 
here is the famous house of the seven gables sign. <eos> the man next to the well on a cold day. <eos> a flattering picture of the female outside during the visit. <eos> the sign of the hooper hathaway house since 1862. <eos> the dock outside near the water on an overcast day.
i went on a cruise last weekend. <eos> the ship was enormous. <eos> there were also some christmas decorations there. <eos> when we were in town we were able to check out some of the shops. <eos> i had a great time there.
a woman visited florida, where she saw large cruises approach the tourist hot spots. <eos> the architecture of the area and the plants were more tropical in appearance than the rest of the united states. <eos> the quirky decorations, such as this flamingo-feathered christmas tree, were an illustration of an area with a unique flavor. <eos> the people in the area were easy going. <eos> a panoramic shot of a plaza shows the energy and activity of this locale. 
i decided to go to the beach for the day.  <eos> this is my rental house, its so cute.  <eos> i had to put this cute christmas tree up.  <eos> later i met up with some friends.  <eos> we went downtown where there was a lot going on. 
the cruise ship look so majestic as it comes in the port. <eos> friends are waiting to greet the passengers. <eos> the port is all decked out for christmas, including this wonderful tree. <eos> this lamp is so cool, i wonder where you find such a thing. <eos> any of the passengers would like to get their picture taken professionally certainly have that option here.
i missed my cruise ship and got stranded <eos> so i rented a house for a week <eos> it had a gawdy tree on the porch <eos> there were lots of cyclists around  <eos> the town square was cool
love this style of french louisiana. <eos> very cool designs are so comfortable and inviting. <eos> i don't like traffic circles much though. <eos> these look creepy in black and white though. <eos> isn't this just the greatest? i could live here forever.
the town was decorated for christmas. <eos> a simple tree had been created using lights and few other materials. <eos> lights tastefully lined a balcony of one building . . , <eos> and traced the architectural features of another. <eos> even without holiday lights, however, the town would be beautiful.
our hotel is so beautiful.  <eos> i loved all the archways and colorful lights.  <eos> a monument out front was a nod to the french.  <eos> the hotel near us is said to be haunted.  <eos> we took a carriage ride to tour the haunted hotel. 
ashley recently took her family on a vacation. she felt that they needed to get away. <eos> they went to visit her parents at their mansion for a little while, but left because she didn't get along with her mother very well. <eos> she then checked the family into a hotel for the night. <eos> they woke up early and traveled all day and ended up in a different hotel the next night. <eos> in the morning they got up early and drove to their destination. they visited a friend in a small town and they had the time of their lives. 
a green light gives the building an eerie look. <eos> the light sculpture adds color to the night. <eos> a ornate hotel lit up at night. <eos> the hotel across the street lit up for the night. <eos> the sunset means night is coming soon to the town.
i took the kids out to play some games. <eos> they had a lot of fun with the glow sticks. <eos> there as also an air hockey table. <eos> afterward we went outside to hang out. <eos> we did some snowboarding.
after dinner the family began to walk home  <eos> and saw someone selling glow sticks which the kids played with all night  <eos> the next morning the family went sledding  <eos> and i stayed inside  <eos> because i had a little peace and quiet without the kids 
the night here was cold but pleasant after the snowstorm. <eos> we used some of these light devices to make our way around safely. <eos> jerry and his son do a little sledding in the morning before breakfast <eos> his wife sarah is in good spirits this morning and is making breakfast. <eos> the couple discusses their plans for the day as their daughter checks out the refrigerator.
i gave my two sons a long playdate with me today. <eos> they got glowsticks that they could play with while it was dark out. <eos> they sat and played air hockey by the christmas tree in our house. <eos> one of my sons sat on my back when we were sledding down a hill. <eos> they watched me snowboard for a while as well.
our neighborhood was having a moonlight watch party.  <eos> we all bought glowsticks, so that we could all light up like moon.  <eos> earlier in the day, my husband took the kids sledding.  <eos> i was preparing some quick snacks for the moonlight party.  <eos> i asked a couple of my neighbors to help me prepare the snack. 
the facility was cool and sterile.  <eos> there were ropes and labels, <eos> this window required bars. <eos> everything was rusted and metal. <eos> the sky was also grey. 
it was almost war time <eos> it was time for the jacson 27 to go to battle <eos> it was an older ship but could still be useful <eos> they were gonna teach the enemy a thing or two <eos> war was on the horizon and jacson 27 was gonna hold its own 
we took the day to visit an old abandoned ship. <eos> the name of the ship was jascon 27. <eos> it had been used in war for many of years. <eos> it was so old it was starting to rust. <eos> overall, it was a great learning experience.
many windows to watch the daily lives of all those who work so hard on the docks. <eos> the barge where i work and help deliver goods for all those people behind the windows. <eos> barges have all the living quarters we need as we travel the water ways. <eos> units to provide air and ventilation for our comfort. <eos> looking out upon our journey and protecting us from storms the shutters of our abode.
we were down by the docks <eos> it was very interesting  <eos> there was nothing going on  <eos> it was pretty much abandoned  <eos> the dry docks are empty
there was a massive snowstorm where i live yesterday. <eos> the snow was so deep you could barely walk in it. <eos> i took my children out to play for a while. <eos> we went sledding and had a blast going down hills. <eos> after a long day of playing in the snow it was time to bring the kids inside to warm up.
we set out early today. <eos> the path was still clear as no new snow fell last night. <eos> the air was bitter cold. <eos> not a bird was chirping. it was so quiet. <eos> this sunrise was so gorgeous over the snow and ice.
i always loved midwinter in the north. <eos> the snow is piled up high enough to go sledding. <eos> walking on the packed snow is fun. <eos> the roads are nothing but packed snow and dirt. <eos> the bare trees allow you to see for miles.
when i went out for a walk this morning i was taken aback by just how beautiful the snow was.  <eos> we get snow back home, but nothing like how this snow just seems to go on forever.  <eos> i was happy to see others out enjoying the snow.  <eos> the roadway was so nicely cleared.  <eos> and you couldn't beat watching the sunrise in such a place. 
after the blizzard, the morning revealed a misty frozen lake. <eos> despite the chill and deep snow everyone went out to take in the view. <eos> the neighbor's farm was completely snowed in. <eos> the tree branches too were heavy with snow. <eos> the stark landscape was a sight to behold.
we arrived around sunset and it was beautiful. <eos> we had to walk to our hotel, but that was not a problem. <eos> except for alex, whom was very tired. <eos> we walked to the pier and checked out the fishing boats... <eos> and, ty was a very happy boy!
i went for a walk one day. <eos> there were many buildings in the area. <eos> they were all very old. <eos> some of them needed to be repainted. <eos> after i did some shopping i went back home.
my friend gave me a tour of his local area a couple weeks ago. <eos> he has a cute kid who got to look out on all the balconies we could see. <eos> there was an area outside you could walk out onto and see the whole town. <eos> when we were out walking, we saw doors with bright pink outlines. <eos> we ended up in a local coffee shop where we stopped to chat for a while.
check out the view from this window. <eos> i love the large windows and balcony. <eos> the view is so beautiful and breath-taking, i can sit out here for hours. <eos> she is entering the building. <eos> this is our living space, it is kind of cluttered.
the sun was just rising over the small town. <eos> there was a hotel that was on the far side of town. <eos> a woman and her husband and son were on vacation here. <eos> they were out on their deck, relaxing and watching boats. <eos> later in the day they headed out to tour the town a bit.
i went to venice italy for a vacation to look at the cathedrals. <eos> this is the bed and breakfast where we stayed. <eos> the view was amazing. <eos> there was some unusual furniture in the room. <eos> we took the time to see their famous waterways.
the large castle build was magnificent. <eos> the picture of the firl in front of the pond with the bulding in the background. <eos> the historic building had character on thd city corner street. <eos> the location that we ate at had a beautiful view. <eos> the two of us are just hanging out after an eventful day.
the chateau we stayed at for our vacation was beautiful.  <eos> it was surrounded by a moat we had to boat across.  <eos> one night we visited a local pub for dinner and drinks.  <eos> the next morning for breakfast we sat on the balcony of the chateau and admired the view.  <eos> it started raining so we stayed inside all day and relaxed on the couches. 
we visited the mansion in the morning. <eos> i took a picture by the lake. <eos> then we went to town to visit the shops. <eos> we found a small restaurant and decided to grab a bite to eat. <eos> then we went back to the hotel to relax.
we went around town. first, we went to the church. <eos> the buildings in the area where really cool. <eos> we found a quick place to sit and eat lunch. <eos> after a coffee, we went back out. <eos> we continued our walk through the streets.
we arrived on site and charles met us at the garden. <eos> he would be our tour guide, along with his fancy hat. <eos> he took us around the beautiful grounds... <eos> and, continued through the garden... <eos> and, then we saw it. the beautiful church at the end of the rainbow.
nathan is a photographer for a magazine. <eos> he takes pictures of gardens around the world. <eos> today nathan is taking pictures of a garden in greece. <eos> the garden is vast and full of various plants and flowers. <eos> this garden may have a chance to make the front page of the magazine.
the man is on a tour of this landmark site. <eos> he stops to have his picture taken for future reference on the trip. <eos> a building off in the distance, what could be inside it? <eos> as the tour continued they came across a statue and what looks to be a man made lake. <eos> as the tour stopped to take a photo a fountain that shooting water into the air as soon as the photo was taken.
my hobby is gardening. <eos>  when i got the chance to visit the royal gardens i just had to go. <eos>  they were as beautiful in person as i've ever seen them pictured. <eos>  i walked around for hours marveling at their gardeners skills. <eos> i had such an amazing time, i cannot wait to go again.
they visited the beautiful estate, viewing the amazing hedges surrounding the building. <eos> they loved seeing old buildings. <eos> they found the main part of the house, it was enormous and very old. <eos> the grounds were full of statues and various relics of the past. <eos> they even had a moat that flowed through the estate.
i went for a ride on my boat last week. <eos> i stopped in a very grassy field. <eos> there were many clouds in the sky. <eos> afterward it became very dark. <eos> i decided to leave before it began to rain.
is this vacation house, not the cutest little thing. <eos> the wetlands may be full of bugs, but i love the sounds of the frogs. <eos> the water was very rough out there. this boat looks like its about to topple. <eos> the marina was full on since the storm was coming. <eos> the flags were ferociously blowing.
the family invited us to the water <eos> it was such a beautiful peaceful day at first <eos> then the dark clouds came rolling in <eos> we were afraid to go out on the water <eos> so we stayed in and didn't tempt fate
our sea-side cottage was so cute. <eos> the grass in front of the harbor was worthy of a run through. <eos> we watched the sailboats take off. <eos> most of the boats here were recreational boats. <eos> the marina flag flew high.
the family has a house on the lake they visit every year on vacation. <eos> they own acres of land that is very beautiful during the summer months. <eos> they also have over 20 acres of land for sale. that will sell real easy this time of year. <eos> next to their lake house is a boat dock where they house several boats they own. <eos> this boat dock is the only one in town and it is a beautiful resort during the spring and summer.
donnie went to canada to stay with his dad over the winter at his cabin. <eos> the landscape was cold and harsh but at the same time beautiful. <eos> during the days donnie would hunt for food to eat. <eos> while donnie would be out hunting he took in the beauty of the outdoors. <eos> this was donnie's favorite winter he has ever had and he is coming back next winter.
sam visited japan during the summer. he found the countryside of japan very beautiful.  <eos> a pond emptied into a beautiful manmade river with rocks. <eos> as sam continued to take a look at the landscape, he found a beautiful rock formation. <eos> he was graciously invited to take a tour of someone's house. he noted how neat and beautifully clean the house was. <eos> in the living room, they had an artwork that depicted traditional japanese work.
the countryside is always remarkable in the winter. <eos> the hills shine in the snow. <eos> the streams freeze over. <eos> the trees are weighed down by the snow and ice. <eos> the bridges are slick with ice.
we had a snow storm move through last night. <eos> the hillside looked like it was blanketed in a soft fluffy white blanket. <eos> there wasn't a lot of water in the stream so we were able to walk down near the edge and walk across the rocks. <eos> there were parts of the stream where the top of the water was completely frozen over so the snow just sat on top. <eos> here's a beautiful shot of the bridge that goes over the stream.
we recently headed up to my family's vacation house in the mountains. <eos> in our backyard there is this beautiful mountain. <eos> we often go for walks on the various trails around the house. <eos> we often see a lot of animals and all of their tracks on the trails. <eos> at the end of the trail in this beautiful bridge that goes over a frozen river.
the artist created an interstingg picture of a skull head. <eos> the debris was covered with snow and graffiti. <eos> the individuals created an alert written on the snow. <eos> the vehicle was covered with xnow and graffiti. <eos> the snow covered the junk with people writing on the snow.
someone was getting very creative with graffiti in the snow. is that french? <eos> it was everywhere on this block. <eos> funny saying about the white powder. <eos> and a cartoon character on this car. <eos> this must be the graffiti artist's tag. it was definitely a surprise.
there was no reason not to start our morning out hard-core.  <eos> it felt better painting the snow than the walls.  <eos> red really seemed to stick out against the snow.  <eos> some people are probably going to be really worried before they realize it's just on the snow. <eos> it was a fun day with a lot of fun snow graffiti. 
there was a major snow storms the day before a protest was supposed to happen. <eos>  everybody thought because of the snow nobody would show up to protest. <eos> instead everybody was shocked when the protesters used the snow to create graffiti. <eos>  sara message was plastered everywhere, but did not damage any buildings. <eos> they were able to get their point across without any injuries or damage.
some taggers got creative and spraypainted the snowdrifts.  <eos> some messages were political.  <eos> some messages were ironic.  <eos> others were just tags.  <eos> obvious there was more than one. what a cool idea! 
the famous site was a learning opportunity. <eos> the inside of the structure provided a p!ace for rest. <eos> the exterior was an example of historic building plans. <eos> the grounds contained flowers and other free plants. <eos> she took pictures to remember the event.
the neighborhood where they were house hunting was perfect. <eos> there were lots of beautiful houses. <eos> one of the best features of one was a huge covered porch. <eos> all of the houses were spacious. <eos> some had unique architecture designs.
this is a historic monument in a historic town. <eos> the area is rural and has kept its natural beauty. <eos> most of the houses are very nice with spacious yards. <eos> some have very square designs with flowers and decor. <eos> others have slanted roofs much like a triangle. it is very nice to see the diversity in older architecture.
after we spent our afternoon at the park we decided to walk back home. <eos> we saw a lot of interesting houses along the way. <eos> some of them were enormous. <eos> after a few minutes we were almost there. <eos> finally we arrived and we made some dinner.
i went to the park yesterday to read a new book about architectural design. <eos> most the homes in my neighborhood, like this one, are kind of mundane. <eos> i do appreciate homes with spacious, covered porches. <eos> there are, of course, exceptions, as this is one of the nicest homes i have ever seen. <eos> however, my favorite house in the neighborhood is undoubtedly this one.
for my painting class i need to do a painting of an outdoor scene, so i took a walk today to get some ideas. <eos> this tree captured my interest. i like the shape of the branches. <eos> flowers might be an idea. <eos> i just don't know if i should paint several flowers or just one. <eos> of course a cluster is also an idea. i have much to think ab out before my next class.
i went into the city to do some shopping. <eos> when i got back i decided to take a nap. <eos> afterwards i had to mow the lawn. <eos> the lawn is very big. <eos> i watered the flowers.
i went on a site-seeing tour of my city today. <eos> the architecture was incredible, with stone and cement buildings. <eos> one of them looked like it could have been built by the romans. <eos> standing in a field, we could see the entire city at once. <eos> the local plants are pretty incredibly, since they're so colorful.
spring is my favorite time of year. <eos> the trees are blooming. <eos> the colorful plants come out. <eos> they are fun to look out. <eos> the flowers are always so pretty.
going to the city was great because it was the most gorgeous city i had ever seen. <eos> the buildings were built well and near trees. <eos> the house that we stayed in was large and accommodating. <eos> getting to look out at the blue sky all day was our reward. <eos> the flowers in the grass were gorgeous and we picked some.
mom and dad are celebrating 50 years as husband and wife. <eos> good friends and family were all there. <eos> we count our blessings that we have such great parents. <eos> my sister has put marriage on hold to go to medical school and now wonders if she made the right choice. <eos> i hope that everyone will someday have a love that blooms forever.
my grandma and grandpa came to visit. <eos> they brought there friends. <eos> i had a beer and talked a lot. <eos> the ladies went outside to talk. <eos> everyone loved the flowers.
the couple held a party, everyone was invited. <eos> the people that came, talked all night and conversed about everything. <eos> some people had never met before, still talking to anyone they could. <eos> the night was a hit, and most people loved the party. <eos> at the end of the night, everyone had fun.
these people were involved in a lottery and didn't know they would soon be billionaires. <eos> they met with these people to have dinner and realized they were late to get there lottery ticket. <eos> so, they called the kids and said, please go get our lottery, we never miss. <eos> this woman sold them the ticket in the mini mart next door. <eos> they bought everyone flowers, added a 5,000 dollar check and said, thank you for all of your help.
i took my wife to couple's support group. <eos> we discussed our communication difficulties with other couples. <eos> a therapist helped us to learn techniques. <eos> afterwards, we went out to eat with our daughter. <eos> she had bought us a flower arrangement, which was nice of her.
i went to the convention yesterday. <eos> there were a lot of people there. <eos> i got to meet a lot of different people. <eos> they were all very happy. <eos> we stayed to watch the presentations.
"it's time for our budget meeting. <eos> everyone always loves the ""my name is"" tags. <eos> some brought ear buds just in case of boredom. <eos> others decided to eat while the presentation was going on. <eos> "overall it was a great success.
chester was ready to present, even though he was nervous. <eos> his whole family had arrived to watch his presentation. <eos> along with people from all over the country. <eos> they seemed excited for it to begin.. <eos> and, he finally took the stage.
we arrived at the event. <eos> people shook hands and talked. <eos> after a while, more people showed up. <eos> eventually the conference began. <eos> everyone took their seats and took notes.
our monthly sales meeting was not bad this month.  <eos> jim got stuck with making name tags, but he smiled all the way through it.  <eos> tim had a bad cord on one of his monitors and spent a lot of time trying to fix that.  <eos> jack and raj just grabbed some food and watched from a safe distance.  <eos> but finally everything got underway and it went off without a hitch. 
today we had a cooking party. <eos> many of us got together to create new dishes and enjoy each other's company. <eos> we made beautiful dishes... <eos> each more delicious than the last. <eos> we had a great time at today's cooking party.
i had to cook a lot of food today. <eos> there was so much work to be done. <eos> everyone was going to be coming over soon. <eos> we had to get all of the food prepared. <eos> thankfully i finished everything in time.
the kitchen was the best place to work. <eos> the chefs were most passionate about their creations. <eos> my favorite was the veggie salad. <eos> and the veggie pasta was delicious as well. <eos> sometimes we ate as we went along.
we were preparing for a dinner party at the house tonight.  <eos> my boyfriend is making his signature dish.  <eos> the first course will be a tomato and mozzarella salad.  <eos> my boyfriend is trying to get me to help cook, but i am watching for now.  <eos> the second course will be a egg noodle pasta with vegetables and cheese. 
my roommate is in culinary school. <eos> he is a pretty amazing cook. <eos> he makes us all kinds of fancy dishes. <eos> they look too pretty to eat. <eos> i try to help him, but he's a little demanding.
house party turned out great. <eos> me and my wife are in love. <eos> living room came out great. <eos> me and my son jimmy. <eos> my mother is always smiling.
my husband and i bought a new house for our family. <eos> my favorite room is the bathroom. <eos> our son seems to really like our new house. <eos> we invited our friends over for a house warming party. <eos> but it was rainy outside so we couldn't go on our new deck.
finally saved up enough money for a new house. <eos> the bathroom was a little dated. it also had a window will have to replace that. <eos> julie brought her baby franklin he loved the new house. <eos> the realtor was really nice he gave us a tour at night. <eos> the porch was amazing i imagine i'll be spending hours here.
the couple went to an open house. they were thinking about buying the house. <eos> they look like they may be interested. <eos> there was plenty of storage space in the basement. <eos> there was even a room for the baby! <eos> mom liked the house most of all.
the entry way of the house we toured. <eos> the garden bathtub is something i'm looking for in a new home. <eos> met some new friends at the house tour. <eos> another entry way in our potential new house. <eos> the deck is absolutely grand where i can host parties.
we visited an old castle in europe.  <eos> the ground were meticulously maintained.  <eos> a creek ran right through the grounds.  <eos> we went inside the old structure. it was amazing. <eos> i liked how the hallways went on and on. 
we approached the property that was to be our vacation home. <eos> a nice tall hedge tunnel leads from back yard to garden. <eos> also a large hallway on one side of house. <eos> an awesome looking view from this window. <eos> yet more hallways to venture down and explore.
i visited an old castle. <eos> the grounds were beautiful and spacious.  <eos> there was even a little creek.  <eos> the caste had large arched windows.  <eos> even the entrances were arched. 
i love exploring buildings by myself.  <eos> once you've taken in the outside you get the chance to explore the interior spaces.  <eos> and sometimes you are just overwhelmed by how much time it must have taken to build such structures a long time ago.  <eos> but you understand the drive to build them in such beautiful locations.  <eos> and how the spaces just call for meditation. 
there was a big castle <eos> near a tunnel. <eos> there was a castle <eos> near the field <eos> and the big towers.
we planned on starting the day with some painting. <eos> however, we remembered we lived in new york city. <eos> i googled the best activities in our city... <eos> and, we ended up in central park for a long stroll and a day of peace. <eos> we caught the subway back to queens and talked about our day.
i went for a walk today. <eos> it was very cloudy. <eos> i saw a traffic cone. <eos> i went down to the lake for a little while. <eos> i saw a kite stuck on a tree.
this is a picture of cans. <eos> this is a picture of a skyline. <eos> this is a picture of stone. <eos> this is a picture of a walkway. <eos> this is a picture of a restaurant.
we checked our reserves and unfortunately we were running low on almost everything. <eos> the only place to replenish our stores was the dead city, over run with infected hordes. <eos> checking our fortification for weaknesses, just part of the exit routine.  <eos> we took in the desolate landscape as we made our way to our destination. the emptiness of our surroundings gave us a false sense of security and a false allusion of things to come. <eos> we made our way to the hardware store under cover of darkness. if anything could go wrong it hadn't, yet.
the road was long <eos> and the building was tell <eos> near the cone. <eos> the water was calm <eos> and there was a happy leaf.
i wanted to take some pictures of the area against the darkening sky. <eos> i was able to get out before the sunlight was completely gone and caught this picture of the church. <eos> here is one from further back. <eos> you can see this palace and it's strobe lights with people in the court area. <eos> here is a different view looking up standing very close to the building.
i went on vacation last weekend. <eos> the city was beautiful at night. <eos> i had a great time walking around. <eos> i enjoyed all of the sights. <eos> the buildings were very beautiful.
i toured german village last night. the houses were all so quiet.  <eos> the methodist church was lit with a huge flame. you could see it for miles.  <eos> epic castle was looming in the background. it's such an eerie place.  <eos> over at the imperial armory it was so lit up and beautiful. i wanted to stay here all night but eventually i did move on.  <eos> i came here and placed a blanket down and stared up at the backside of epic castle. i feel fast asleep. 
the buildings are lit of beautifully at night. <eos> i think there is something burning way up in the tower. <eos> just look at the scenery in the night time lights! <eos> and here you can see the lights reflecting on the water. <eos> this building looks really tall because of the angle it was taken.
we walked through the city at night. <eos> we started near some of the castles. <eos> they where huge and pretty amazing. <eos> we crossed town to go see some more. <eos> we ended the night near some of the churches.
our little town has a lot to offer. it's rural but it's beautiful <eos> an old rustic park bench shows the serenity of the area. <eos> the blue sky show our town to be under clear weather today! <eos> our small businesses give our town some of its rustic charm. <eos> the little cafe on the corner is always eager to meet and greet.
when i woke up i was really hungry. <eos> i decided to go and grab some breakfast. <eos> i had to walk to the restaurant. <eos> it was not a long walk. <eos> i stopped at some shops along the way.
the sun casts no shadow on the church. <eos> the benches were made of the finest wood. <eos> the street signs were cheap because they bend easily. <eos> fortunately, the business is successful at this time of year. <eos> there was not much going on in the city however.
went downtown to look for thrift stores. <eos> sat on this bench and never noticed a plaque there. <eos> someone had a bad night, they hit the one way sign, how? <eos> here we are, thrift stores, my favorite. <eos> thought of taking the subway but ducked into this cafe instead.
we started our walk near the church. <eos> we sat at the park for a little bit. <eos> afterwards, we continued down the street. <eos> we passed some great shops along the way. <eos> when we got to the middle of the city we started looking for a place to eat.
as you travel through life, look at god's beauty all around you. <eos> even in the dead of winter he takes joy in his creations. <eos> who else could form this. <eos> or make a tree look like an actual snowflake. <eos> still he gives us his promise of spring.
i went out for a hike last weekend. <eos> there was so much snow everywhere. <eos> it was very cold. <eos> i had a great time out there. <eos> i was all by myself.
she loves the winter and decided to take her new camera out for pictures of the snow. <eos> she got a great shot of the trees with clear blue sky in the background. <eos> another beautiful picture of a thin small tree leaning over from the weight of the snow. <eos> this was a distance shot against the blue sky. <eos> and finally a great shot of a tree with some color peeking out from under the snow.
the snow hit heavy this year. <eos> snow covering most of the trees and ground. <eos> the snow dramatically bending a tree from its natural form. <eos> the skies are clear and warming up. <eos> snow is melting away, coming back next year hopefully.
seeing the snow country was absolutely stunning. <eos> i had never seen trees that were so white and pretty. <eos> one trip almost fell over because of the snow. <eos> the blue sky in the background of the white was so cool. <eos> we walked further in and got to see some of the brown branches.
another day at work. <eos> these cords really need untangled. <eos> really really needed untangled. <eos> finally it was making progress. <eos> just in time for business it was done.
we decided to visit a big city for vacation. <eos> it had wonderful views, especially in the morning. <eos> i was able to see for what felt like miles. <eos> there were many buidlings in the city. <eos> some of the buildings were huge and went high into the air. 
the computer it in our department tried to help the company set up the server. <eos> upon inspection, the computer it realized that someone had tried to reconnect the wires. <eos> all the wires for the computers were tangled. the misplaced wireds caused the computers and internet connection to malfunction. <eos> as a result, the company had to send us home early.  <eos> the computer it spent over 4 hours trying to fix all the tangled wires. the company sent out an email. they prohibit any of the employees from entering the data center room. 
i had a lot of work to do today. <eos> there were so many wires that were tangled up. <eos> i had to untangle all of them. <eos> it took me all day. <eos> eventually i finished and i was allowed to go home.
the view of the city from the building top. <eos> the sun is setting in the distance overlooking the city. <eos> the view away from the sun overlooking the city. <eos> on top of the building is the platform where the pictures were took. <eos> the sun shadows of the tall buildings in the city picture.
our trip to the city was wonderful. <eos> we watched ships passed everyday. <eos> the bridge was beautiful. <eos> we toured a historic light house. <eos> the sunset was lovely our last day here.
san francisco is a great place to get away to. <eos> there are some fantastic views there. <eos> we even got to watch the sunrise. <eos> it was fun to see all the buildings in the city. <eos> this bridge was my favorite place to visit, so magnificant. 
the beautiful city of san francisco can be seen. <eos> the golden gate bridge is shown over the san francisco bay. <eos> the golden gate bridge is red. <eos> this big tower stands tall. <eos> the people stand above the view with the golden gate bridge behind them.
i had a great time last weekend. <eos> i took time off to see many sights around the city. <eos> the bridge was huge. <eos> there were many old buildings to explore. <eos> we had a great time.
the photos of the distance can be very beautiful <eos> and the lake stays very calm. <eos> the golden gate bridge is shinging <eos> and the tower is too. <eos> the bridge will always stay beautiful.
the middle east gets a bad rap, but going there is amazing. <eos> we saw statues that date back centuries and it's really humbling to look at them.  <eos> of course modern transportation is still kind of iffy out there, so the old ways work best, namely camels.  <eos> looking at all this history really made us think. what would our legacy be in 1000 years?  <eos> and of course there was the sphinx. trust me, seeing it on tv and movies is nothing compared to seeing it in real life. 
one of our favorite things on the trip were the sunsets. <eos> during the days, people would sail the lakes. <eos> we made friends with many of the locals. <eos> we had a great time exploring the ruins. <eos> when the ship arrived, we didn't want to leave!
the family visited egypt during the fall. <eos> the children begged their mother to make a funny pose in front of the pharaoh statues. <eos> we took a few pictures of our children next to camels. <eos> the family was hesitant in climbing the pyramid. <eos> we decided to take a picture of the pyramid from afar. if we visit egypt again, the family will not be afraid to climb the pyramid.
i had a lot of fun on vacation in egypt last week. <eos> there were so many ancient ruins that i got to explore. <eos> i also got to ride on a camel. <eos> the stones they used the build the pyramids were very big. <eos> it must have taken them forever to make it.
the old statue was worn out <eos> but people were taking pictures near others. <eos> there were camels for transport <eos> to the great pyramids <eos> and the sphinx too.
the person that lives here called me about taking care of their yard. <eos> i looked at the front yard and was ready to accept the job. <eos> then they showed me the back yard. <eos> that was intimidating. <eos> there was two more buildings with yards to take care of in the back!
i wanted to visit the country side for the weekend. <eos> it was so pretty and full of nature. <eos> the flowers were in full bloom. <eos> this is the house we stayed in and tucked away with nature. <eos> they even had a pond to go swimming in.
my relatives were waiting for my visit at their beautiful villa. <eos> i walked up the steps and saw them waiting for me by the door. <eos> i enjoyed seeing their beautiful garden. <eos> the bushes were neatly trimmed and well taken care of. <eos> the neighborhood was surrounded by trees.
on vacation, i visited a beautiful home. <eos> the home was large, and old, and well manicured. <eos> the gardens were so beautiful and large. <eos> i walked through the gardens to get a closer look at all the plants they had. <eos> i was sad to leave this old stone home, and hope to visit again.
when i got to the house i decided to buy it. <eos> it was beautiful. <eos> very large and the garden was gorgeous. <eos> i like to spend my time walking through the garden. <eos> i can't wait to move in.
we live in a rural area. <eos> we're able to keep chickens at our house. <eos> this is my mom showing off the hen house. <eos> this is my mom showing off her favorite hen. <eos> her favorite part of the whole thing is when the chicks hatch.
i love anything small and fuzzy. <eos> the baby duckling is in my hand. <eos> i'm just about ready to get the chickens outdoors. <eos> my garden is a fun spot for the chickens. <eos> who says you can't catch and hold a chicken!
i just came back from the store with my new pets. <eos> i got some new chickens. <eos> they are very cute. <eos> i put them outside with the other chickens. <eos> they are my best friends.
we visited mother's house for the day. <eos> she has a chicken farm. <eos> this is the chicken coop. <eos> she really loves her chickens. <eos> lastly, this was a baby chicken that just hatched from an egg.
the vacation home was very beautiful  <eos> and had chickens outside. <eos> the owner held the chicken <eos> even though the chicken did not like it. <eos> it had a baby chicken that same day.
the park had a nice lake and there were a lot of ducks.  <eos> these little ducks are so well behaved. <eos> these children seem to enjoy playing with the duck family.  <eos> we found some nice places to rest and cool off. <eos> i really liked these frog statues, this one is my favorite. 
a group of friends decided to visit the tadpole playground. <eos> they walked through the park... <eos> and took pictures with the statues. <eos> after their walk they grabbed a bite to eat... <eos> and sat on the grass. to remember their trip, they took one last picture before heading home.
i love to travel <eos> this place is amazing <eos> so much to see <eos> and do <eos> i love this place
enjoying the day at the local pond. <eos> loving the duck statue. <eos> look at all the cute ducklings. my kids love them. <eos> sitting the grass relaxing for awhile. <eos> posing with a frog.
a group of friends decided to take a walk in the peaceful boston commons. <eos> one of them stopped to pose with the famous duckling statues that were inspired by a children's story. <eos> they watched a group of children enjoying the ducklings themselves. <eos> they paused for a brief rest in the shade of a tree. <eos> these playful frog statues also caught their eye.
hey, let's all party. <eos> no. we don't like to party. <eos> let's sit here and judge them while they party. <eos> can i join in? <eos> we're too cool for these losers, let's go.
tom and lisa posing for a picture while waiting for the show to start. <eos> jamie brought little suzy along to keep her entertained. <eos> kelly rocking the pink cowboy hat like only she can. <eos> the light started to fade and the music started. <eos> tommy dancing to the beat of the music.
we got to the park...and it was wonderful. <eos> we brought the baby and she was sleeping. <eos> but, the rest of us enjoyed ourselves. <eos> we hung out with many we haven't seen in a long time. <eos> and, even were given tickets to the gun show.
we spent the day at the park. <eos> we had the babies there. <eos> we had the grannies there. <eos> at dusk we all did a prayer circle. <eos> i think i need a new tattoo to commemorate the occasion.
we went out ot the pinic on sunday. <eos> all the friends came over. <eos> we lounged out on the grass. <eos> we gossiped some after lunch. <eos> we stayed there till the sun went down.
it was the fourth of july. <eos> time for lots of fireworks and fun. <eos> there was lots of ooooo's and ahhhh's. <eos> my family and i love watching the fireworks each and every year. <eos> the finale is always the best, except it means it's almost over.
a fireworks show was held on the fourth of july. the show started with a bright pink fire work bursting in the sky. <eos> it was followed by a bright blue and yellow explosion.  <eos> the fire works exploded in time with music. there were white fire works... <eos> and blue fire works.  <eos> the finale was spectacular. multiple red and pink fire works exploded at the same time in the sky. the show was a hit!
i love to travel <eos> this place is amazing <eos> so much to see <eos> and do <eos> i will return
this is a picture of fireworks. <eos> this is a picture of pink fireworks. <eos> the fireworks are blue. <eos> the fireworks are orange and white. <eos> this is a picture of white fireworks.
july 4th fireworks always mesmerizes especially the bright star like ones. <eos> the forelli brothers improved this year's show by adding red highlights.  <eos> and blue spheres with exploding stars in the center. <eos> and golden showers that streaked down like meteors. <eos> and increased the luminosity of the crowd favorite chrysanthemum bursts.
i took my family to see the fireworks tonight. they were so bright on the dark sky.  <eos> the orange ones were my favorite. they were so big.  <eos> the white ones were my husbands favorite. he's colorblind though so white seems to be his favorite color anyways.  <eos> my daughters loved the crazy colored ones that shot all over the place.  <eos> the grand finale was amazing. they shot up many orange and white fireworks. 
the show started of with lots of excitement and a big band. <eos> i really liked this one with the smaller sub-explosions. <eos> these little ones were so loud that i had to cover my ears. <eos> this feathery firework was very unique. <eos> the finale started with red, white, and blue which soon followed.
"it was the fourth of july! <eos> we got the family together to watch the fireworks. <eos> the display was spectacular. <eos> there was lots of ""ooh""ing and ""aah""ing from the crowd. <eos> "the finale was mindblowing!
the fireworks where awesome. <eos> the started out simple. <eos> but built throughout the night. <eos> they got a bit crazy. <eos> then, the grand finally blew us away.
the fireworks this year were amazing.  <eos> some were like colorful star-flowers falling from fire bursts.  <eos> some went multicolored from green to red.  <eos> many exploded from the ground making a peacock tail of fire.  <eos> brilliant colors of light made for a beautiful night. 
i tried baking cookies for halloween this year. <eos> i tried to get creative. <eos> these lips shaped cookies turned out pretty well. <eos> i was also kind of proud of the bat cookies. <eos> of course my little brother has to do stuff like this.
jerry made a funny cookie at the halloween party. <eos> a more conventionally decorated cookie. <eos> the rolling stones would be very proud. <eos> a spooky cookie to go with the rest of the night. <eos> a collection of very well decorated cookies from the halloween party.
kathy made her special cookies <eos> every halloween she had something for the kdis <eos> this year it was some big red lips <eos> and followed by some spooky ghosts <eos> and uh oh looks like someone spoiled kathy's cookies 
i made a lot oc ookies for the party tonight. <eos> i made all different kinds. <eos> some of them are salty. <eos> i made lots of different designs as well. <eos> i had a great time.
today we decorated cookies. <eos> we had the simple ones. <eos> we also had the creative ones. <eos> my son even made a scary one. <eos> of course my husband had to make a smart ass one.
i took some photos of fireworks over the 4th of july. <eos> i just bought a new camera and wanted to try it out.  <eos> this is on my favorites because of the twisted tail and the starting of the explosion. <eos> this one looks like a big fuzzy ball. but it's actually a ball of fire! <eos> this one is great too because there are so many explosions at the same time.
it's normal to see fireworks like this one and they are a bit run of the mill. <eos> what's neat though is to see things like this where the fireworks workers mess around and create something truly unique. <eos> their creativity continuing throughout the show. <eos> then before you know it they are back to the beginning again, only this time things are a bit different. <eos> there intention seems to almost be to bring the fireworks as close as possible. 
we decided to go to the town fireworks on the fourth of july. <eos> the weather was perfect with a clear sky. <eos> there were some interesting shapes displayed. <eos> the colors were brilliant. <eos> the finale was awesome!
we went and saw the local fireworks. <eos> the went way up jigh. <eos> some looked like shooting stars.  <eos> i wish this was mroe than once a year. <eos> we had a blast.
the night sky lit up with fireworks. <eos> there were all colors, even yellows and reds.  <eos> some floated down like golden rain.  <eos> some burst in giant displays of red.  <eos> sometimes, even two shone at once.
the kids are ready to watch the parade. <eos> even the baby is ready. he looks so cute. <eos> a big crowd has gathered to watch. <eos> an old fashioned fire truck lead the parade. <eos> the kids are eagerly grabbing up the candy.
sarah was bored and restless because nothing much had happened.  <eos> the parade kicked off with the fire engine's arrival. <eos> the crowd got over excited and rushed towards the floats. <eos> security quickly intervened to prevent any incident. <eos> all the commotion grabbed sarah's attention and she watched quietly. 
it was a sunny afternoon, and we had planned to check out the parade. <eos> mom and baby were both dressed up festively. <eos> we had a lot of fun watching all of the floats and cars go by. <eos> i loved the antique fire truck that we saw. <eos> afterward we and the rest of the crowd dispersed and headed home.
a brother and his sister sit in the backyard and share a secret. <eos> a mother shows her baby the wonders of the the park. <eos> onlookers watcher the parade wit great enthusiam. <eos> a fire engine is part of the parade. <eos> a float goes by in the parade and the crowd cheers.
we spent the fourth of july with the whole family. <eos> we were getting ready and we even dressed up the baby. <eos> we attended a local parade. <eos> there were many trucks and floats that passed by. <eos> they even threw buckets of water on people for fun.
i have a brother who lives in the swamps of the everglades. <eos> there are super long bridges to get from place to place. <eos> they also have regular looking beaches down there. <eos> my brother likes to joke about his place being hotel california. <eos> he's not your typical swamp dweller and cleans up well.
today was the day baby sarah was going to go to the beach. <eos> she was all ready and looking at her parents if it was time to go. <eos> she even took a look out of the window. <eos> this kid really wanted to go to the beach outside. <eos> finally they took the baby outside to have fun on the beach.
my father decorated his front porch with red, white and blue for his independence celebration. <eos> we went to the ocean afterwards. <eos> we relaxed on the beach because no one was there. <eos> we went back home and saw that he put a hotel california sign the room we were staying at.  <eos> he has a strange sense of humor but our daughter loves him.
we visited my parents house, which is close to the beach. <eos> their land is next to the ocean. <eos> the beach, however, is a little ways down the road. <eos> my mom showed my cousins poem he did in school. <eos> my dad enjoyed his time with his granddaughter.
spending the day at the lake. <eos> look at that beautiful face! i love my daughter. <eos> here we are together looking outside. <eos> look at that face. <eos> posing by the water on the beach.
everybody arrived on time for the big walk n' breakfast charity event. <eos> even gladys and dorothy remembered to bring their walking shoes. <eos> after the walk, they were all clamoring for their breakfast. <eos> norman and lila set up the breakfast buffet while the crew was performing the walk and it looks like they just finished their preparations! <eos> breakfast is served for all who participated in the walk!
jerry pulled up to the picnic with his custom built horse trailer.  <eos> once parked they prepared to serve the many guests.  <eos> the trailer had actually been modified into a small kitchen complete with a table.  <eos> people mingled as the food was being prepared.  <eos> eventually everyone got in line to eat and enjoy jerry's famous ribs.

on the road trip, we took a truck and a camper. <eos> mom opened the door of the camper to peek inside. <eos> inside was a picnic table filled with food. <eos> people heard about it and started to come by. <eos> more people showed for the wonderful sight inside the camper.
our town can offer a different sort of street food experience. <eos> have to be dressed comfortably, to maximize the experience! <eos> people are already gathering together for food. <eos> other than the food itself, cars are offered to dine in. <eos> the cars can offer quite a cozy get-together.
this is what i fuel up before a big race. <eos> we started the day under cloudy conditions. <eos> soon though the sun was out. <eos> as evening fell we celebrated our race achievements. <eos> we deserved the hotdogs they provided.

maggie wore her leather clothes over her foot race clothes. <eos> she rode her motorcycle to the race.  <eos> she laughed at all the other participants because she knew they were no real threat. <eos> she overcame each racer in turn. <eos> maggie left all the other racers far behind in her quest for first place.

i wanted to do something different for my birthday so i convinced my firends to enter a dance contest with me. <eos> everyone had a good time goofing around, but they were not very good dancers. <eos> these two got zero points on their first dance and were eliminated, but they stayed till the end. <eos> i couldn't believe it when i was eliminated, but it was still fun trying. <eos> the winners were unknown to me, but you can see how well they were dancing.
the race line up started in the very early morning. <eos> we git a good start. <eos> there was a large crowd already. <eos> my favorite was running by the river. <eos> i saw my friend at the finish line.
before the sun set, we were preparing for our night 5k run. <eos> it did not take long before the streets were dark. <eos> some of the racers were doing more chatting than racing. <eos> the city was full of spectators, racers, and other people who were there to have a fun evening in the city. <eos> my favorite part of the evening was running through this section of crowded street while getting high fives as i passed by.
when i got to the race it was early morning and the runners were almost finished. <eos> they were nearly at the finished line. <eos> all of the people had come to see who the winner would be. <eos> eventually she came round the corner as the sun was rising and she finished the race. <eos> she was very happy.
we are here for a mother and daughter marathon run happening in the city tonight. <eos> the city and sidewalks look like a blur when i am running. <eos> even the people are blurs as i run past them. <eos> everyone who has finished the marathon already are gathered at the finishing line. <eos> the runners who already finished are at the finish line to cheer on the other runners. 
the race went to darkness <eos> and people were still celebrating. <eos> everyone managed to finish though <eos> and earlier it was rainy <eos> while the pictures were taken.
it was the day of the big race. <eos> hundreds of people showed up in the city center to watch the runners. <eos> the finish line had two red arches; people could see it from blocks away. <eos> other people lined up in the parking lot waiting for their runners to appear. <eos> one man decided to honor the veterans by taking his photo in front of the famous war scene. 
i spent the weekend at the pier. <eos> it was such a great day and the weather was perfect. <eos> i saw a lot of the sights and sounds. <eos> the boardwalk was great and had a great trail. <eos> the water looked so serine. 
the beach was a lot of fun. there was a marathon event going on. <eos> i met some of the runners. they were very nice. <eos> there were many people watching. <eos> afterward there was a big parade. <eos> i had a great time there.

the front runners raced through the city. <eos> another group followed behind. <eos> some waved at supporters. <eos> there were many participants in the race. <eos> some had to walk to the finish line.
everyone was excited to watch the big race. <eos> the runners were passing by adoring crowds. <eos> one of the runners, doug, waved at his mom as he ran by. <eos> doug was pretty popular, so he was waving at a lot of people along the route. <eos> it seemed like everyone was having a good time at the race.
the runners just began the race. <eos> they were slowly taking off from the starting position. <eos> there were so many people running. <eos> i watched them go by for a few minutes. <eos> after a while i left to find something to eat.
it's a dead heat for first plce  <eos> and now the majority of the racers are coming across the line  <eos> it takes dedication to run a race  <eos> all the crowds of people and the long track to run  <eos> but the cause makes it all worth while 
the race was coming to an end <eos> and the people were running fast. <eos> the walkers were finishing too <eos> before they sped up <eos> and finished the race too.
we went to the airport. <eos> there was lots of waiting. <eos> then we gave some hugs. <eos> the trip ended so fast. <eos> parting is such sweet sorrow.
the group of friends arrived early in the morning to relay race. <eos> groups of participants waited in line to get checked in. <eos> next, the race finally began and the participants were off! <eos> 5 miles later, the finish line was finally approaching. <eos> the group of friends took a picture after accomplishing their marathon! 
when we got the airport it was very emotional. <eos> we were very glad to see our family and friends after being away for so long. <eos> they were all happy to see us as well. <eos> it was a great day. <eos> afterward we all grabbed everyone's luggage and went to a restaurant.
on the last day of the trip, everyone met at the airport to say goodbye. <eos> there were silly poses. <eos> there were sweet moments too. <eos> someone snapped a quick picture of mom. <eos> and then finally, the goodbye hugs before taking the escalator to the terminal.
there was a fun time at the airport. <eos> people were dancing <eos> and taking photos of themselves <eos> as well as random people. <eos> people were greeting others as well.

there were many people in the race <eos> and they were struggling to finish.  <eos> they finally did though <eos> with all the support <eos> and took awesome photos.
the party got really weird last night. <eos> the girls were showing off their tatoos. <eos> the guys played some version of a twister game. <eos> i'm not sure what happened to the girls after the party. <eos> he might know the answer to that.
i decided to hang out with a good friend. <eos> we also invited some other friends over. <eos> we are very close, best friends since high school. <eos> here is my girlfriend showing me who's boss. <eos> it was a very fun night and full of laughter. 
i had a great time at the house party yesterday. <eos> some people showed me their cool tattoos. <eos> everyone was laughing. <eos> some people had fallen asleep. <eos> after a few hours i decided to leave because i had work in the morning.
today i had a bunch of friends over for a party. <eos> they are such an entertaining bunch when we all get together. <eos> i even had over some old friends i haven't seen in a very long time. <eos> we all had such a good time goofing around. <eos> everyone raise a hand is ready for the next party!
there were many funs times at the party <eos> and tattoos were shown off. <eos> then they laid down <eos> and took photos drunk <eos> before they did not know what to think.
i was getting ready for a big concert. <eos> we were playing outdoors. <eos> my bandmates and i were so excited. <eos> we had a great show and wanted to celebrate. <eos> smoking a cigratte hit the spot!
first, we grabbed a quick bite to eat.  <eos> then we walked around the market place. <eos> next we joined other spectators to watch the runners. <eos> soon, the runners passed by us. <eos> that night, we enjoyed some street performers.
johnny was nervous to before performing on stage. <eos> during his performance, he mostly looked down at his guitar. <eos> one fan, carl, watches intently. <eos> after the show, carl and johnny have a drink together. <eos> they decide to go out on the balcony and smoke.
i practiced playing my guitar for hours before i had to leave for the performance. <eos> when i got there my band was already setting up. <eos> everyone was there to see us. <eos> i set it up and they watched us play. <eos> we were very good and everyone gave us cigarettes afterward.
the guy was practicing guitar <eos> before his concert. <eos> many attended <eos> and even smoked inside,  <eos> as well as outside.
a beautiful square to take a rest if you don't mind the birds. <eos> these waterways are used to get around the city. <eos> the churches and artwork are outstanding. <eos> there are lots of places to sit down and grab a bite to eat. <eos> you can, also, pick up fresh produce on any corner.
venice! this is where we stayed. not sure i could get used to living on water. <eos> we took a gondola ride, and he even sang to us. <eos> creepy, narrow alleyway. not going down there. <eos> time for lunch. it's nice eating outside except for the birds. <eos> even the fresh produce is on boats. just too weird.
many birds were present in the inner city. the family took a picture of all the birds.  <eos> the family walked towards the center of the city in search of riding a gondola.  <eos> after riding a gondola, we decided to visit a cathedral. <eos> we were beginning to get hungry. the table in the middle is where we decided to eat.  <eos> the family tried fresh fruit. most of the fruit was bought at these little merchant stands throughout the city.
venice is a wonderful city for tourists -- and pigeons, too! <eos> the famous canals, and the gondolas and barges that travel on them, are the first things everyone wants to see. <eos> take the time to explore the magnificent old churches, and you'll be amazed by beautiful frescoes like this one. <eos> you're never far from a pleasant cafe where you can relax with a snack and some espresso, or a glass of wine. <eos> shopping is a delightful adventure here too -- you'll find everything from fine jewelry to delicious fresh produce!
the building was looking very nice <eos> when the canal boat took off. <eos> the people saw an alley too <eos> before going back to the square  <eos> and visiting the market.
i take boring pictures. <eos> here is my clock. <eos> here is my coffee. <eos> here's a book i saw. <eos> i need to get out more.
started the day with the news. <eos> looked at the clock and woke up. <eos> had to get the coffee going. <eos> i wanted to get my swim in. <eos> i ended the day with light reading material.
the family is in the room together watching the sports game. <eos> the d.v.r. is ready to play the movie. <eos> they're cooking for the famiy <eos> this is the family's favorite book samurai executioner <eos> the set for the the show is being set up.
he watched the news on the television. <eos> he decided to dvr it for later.  <eos> he got up and made the coffee.  <eos> he grabbed his book just before leaving.  <eos> as he walked he noticed scaffolding had been erected but he wasn't sure why. 
the tv show was interesting <eos> so the person changed the channel <eos> before they made coffee. <eos> then they wanted to read  <eos> outside near the powerplant.
this is a picture of my trip to greece. <eos> they were some great views there. <eos> the city was wide open and so many people around there. <eos> i was not afraid of heights at least! <eos> the views were so amazing, i can't wait to go back next year.
our vacation to europe was fabulous. <eos> we toured many places and saw this interesting church bell. <eos> this is a view from atop the bell tower. <eos> inside the church were many ornate objects. <eos> on our way out, we noticed this statue.
we visited a historic town today. <eos> here is one of the older bells they rang there. <eos> the roofs of the houses here were so unique. <eos> here is a shrine that was in one of the tourist buildings. <eos> at night, we visited a pillar.
when i went on vacation last week i had a great time. <eos> there were many old places to see. <eos> a lot of the buildings were built a long time ago. <eos> there was so much unique furniture. <eos> i had a great time there.
the bell was old but not rusty <eos> and it was in the tall tower. <eos> the shops were outside the tower <eos> and the buildings were even connected <eos> in the city with the orange roofs.
when we were in thailand we got to go to the local farmer's market. <eos> there were many local farmers selling all sorts or fruits and vegetables. <eos> some vendors had meats and cheeses and fresh fish. <eos> we had lunch at the market's open air restaurant. <eos> after lunch, we found a small candy shop and got some dessert.
it was a great day to go shopping outside. <eos> we wanted to get some groceries for the week <eos> we decided to go to a farmer's market for the food. <eos> they had so much to choose from. <eos> we wound up getting a lot of fruits for the upcoming week.
we went to a market in china town today. <eos> they had all these small shops. <eos> one shop even sold all these flowers. <eos> there were tons of food vendors. <eos> we ended up getting a lot of peppers.
there is a display of many flowers to choose from at so many different color and type. <eos> many different bowls which contain different type of vegetables such as tomatoes, pepper and other vegetables. <eos> the crowd enjoying their shopping with so many items to choose from. <eos> many tables and chairs for sitting outside and enjoy a snack. <eos> there is a man standing in front of the display section. 
the market had many fruits <eos> and peppers too. <eos> there were many people there <eos> and they sat at tables <eos> before buying food at the grocery.
i decided to try out nico's fish market for lunch yesterday. <eos> the restaurant's architectural design was impressive. <eos> the ambiance and interior organization of the restaurant is fantastic. <eos> i surely enjoyed my meal, but was unable to finish it due to the generous portions. <eos> the toffee cream cheese chews were my dessert of choice. they were delicious.
the bakery was stocked with goods. <eos> patrons had their favorites they waited in line for. <eos> the menu was large and diverse. <eos> and offered something for everyone. <eos> outside there was patio seating.
this is nico's fish market. <eos> it is a small business. it has an outdoor diner <eos> and an indoor diner that includes a bar. <eos> the food is juicy and fresh and made by a great cook. <eos> if you get full on the entree, you can take your desert to go. it is a really nice place to have a meal.
last week we went to try out a new restaurant that just opened up. <eos> there were a lot of people dining there. <eos> we waited for a few minutes and then they seated us. <eos> the food was delicious. <eos> after we ate we ordered dessert to go.
the restaurant sign lists the daily specials. <eos> the exterior of the restaurant. <eos> the eatery is bustling with people. <eos> the exotic food at the location is excellent. <eos> the desserts are to die for here.
the streets were crowded. <eos> what was this hot dog doing? <eos> at least the river was pretty. <eos> it looked great at night. <eos> they even lit up the ships.
these people came to go on a tour of the city. here is a church. <eos> the door of the church is very old. <eos> after the church, they went for lunch and found this hot dog. <eos> after lunch, they went on a tour and saw people making some food in a pot. <eos> as night falls, they go out on the water to see the lights of the city.
i walked down to the hot dog restaurant for some food. <eos> after i ate there i decided to take a walk down by the pier. <eos> the water was very calm at night. <eos> the pier was beautiful in the evening. <eos> i had a great time.
our vacation was a strange mix of fancy and weird. the castle we stayed in was certainly fancy! <eos> the door alone was enough to stun you. <eos> however, just down the street from the castle was this weird hot dog statue. <eos> it was outside a hot dog cookery. we had to go in and get one. <eos> the bay was back to fancy---a beautiful sight at night.
the castle had two big towers <eos> and an awesome door too. <eos> the big hotdog <eos> was attracting people who cooked. <eos> they even stayed until darkness came.
when we got to the city, we expected to see some pretty modern things.  <eos> imagine our surprise when we found an old style carnival right in the middle of the city.  <eos> it was like we had stepped back into the past almost.  <eos> we bought food, souvenirs, all kinds of little nicknacks.  <eos> and before we knew it, the place was ready to close and we had to leave. 
we went to the city for a big party in the streets. <eos> we rode the carousal at night when the lights were bright.  <eos> the bridge that crossed over the water was even lit up. <eos> there were so many different fun games to play that night. <eos> even during the night people were out riding their bikes.
the skyscrapers are some of the tallest buildings across the country.  <eos> at night, the city hosted a nightly carnival. <eos> the bridge is much more convenient at night. we decided to use the bridge to get to the city carnival in record breaking time.  <eos> many vendors had great food to offer at the carnival. <eos> the carnival had many inner city people show up. 
i went for walk last night. <eos> there were a lot of people at the amusement park. <eos> nearby was the market. they always sell many unique and interesting things. <eos> i stopped to grab some food. <eos> after people starting to leave i decided to leave as well.
the city was pretty at night <eos> and had a merry go round too. <eos> the market was lit up  <eos> and had many customers <eos> before darkness and rain fell on the market.
i went to a new restaurant yesterday. <eos> the servings were huge. <eos> i got stuffed full of food. <eos> then i went for a walk to walk it off. <eos> finally, hours later i went back to my car and went home.
we went out for a tour of our vacation destination. <eos> we stopped at a nice place to eat and were forced to tie bowser up outside. <eos> ned ordered a huge plate of fries. <eos> i told him not to eat them all. <eos> later that evening we headed to take in the night life.
he's clearly pleased with the prospect of being treated to a meal.  <eos> and because the meal was on me, he ordered liberally. this was just the appetizer.  <eos> he couldn't take my request to take a picture of the occasion seriously.  <eos> afterwards, we decided to walk off the meal by visiting a local street fair.  <eos> we did not, however, succumb to the temptation of live nude dancing. at least not on this afternoon. 
jim was a fun loving guy.  <eos> he could make the simplest meal feel like a real treat, even just a plate of french fries.  <eos> his goofy faces were incredibly, especially with his beard to accent them. <eos> after eating, he'd go to the food booths and buy something strange for dessert, to make us all gag. <eos> i hated to see his signature blue minivan leave. he always drove a minivan, although he was single without kids!
this is the ferry we are going to take <eos> doggie is waiting for his owner, tied to a street light <eos> he can't wait to go ham on that plate of food <eos> making funny faces in a restaurant <eos> big city, bright lights is not my thing
i went down the street last weekend. <eos> there was a tsunami warning issued. <eos> i decided to hang around. <eos> there were not many people outside. <eos> a camera man wanted to ask me why i was still there.
the storm meant many people were leaving. <eos> the evacuation route was clearly marked. <eos> some people stayed behind. <eos> they boarded up their windows in an effort to hunker down.  <eos> other people had to stay to keep order. 
traffic was blocked off today when i tried to go home from work.  <eos> it was at the tsunami evacuation area.  <eos> i didn't see an accident anywhere but i did see blood on the side of this building.  <eos> blood was across the street as well. it was speckled all over.  <eos> a woman was talking to the news. she was crying talking about a woman that got run over. i was horrified. 
we sped into the city and made a quick right turn. <eos> we were trying to get away from the hurricane as fast as possible. <eos> the buildings were all boarded up. <eos> even the store on the corner! <eos> even with the impending storm, some refused to leave and were going to ride it out.
the traffic was bad <eos> in the area. <eos> the door was boarded up <eos> and the corner was too. <eos> there was a guy filming.
oh boy mitcham milly. <eos> that means it's market day. <eos> look at all the safron! <eos> and the fresh flowers. <eos> but i was here to hit the bottle!
it is time to go to the market and see what is for sale. <eos> there are pots of spices in the market. <eos> here is a huge bowl of saffron! <eos> there are people that sell home made goods. <eos> here is some home made syrup for sale.
i went to the market to buy some spices. <eos> they had so many different kinds there. <eos> it was for a very good price. <eos> i bought what i needed and then i browsed for a bit more. <eos> i decided to buy some wine as well.
i went down to this cool flower and drink shop to see what all the fuss was about. <eos> they had all of these cool powders and stuff for sale. <eos> here is a close up of the one that i thought was the best. <eos> they make these flower scented drinks that look really delicious. <eos> they also make some wines. you know i had to try one of those!
the flowers were blooming  <eos> and there were many spices for sale <eos> including curcuma. <eos> there was also bottled items <eos> that were very intricate.
we had a lot of work to do today. <eos> there were many service members there. <eos> i had a great time at the office. <eos> i was escorted back home. <eos> they were very serious.
the united states played the major role in winning the war against the nazis and their allies in wwii and this is the white house where our president is allowed to stay during his 4 to 8 year term. <eos> the nazis in germany set up prison death camps where they murdered millions of jews during wwii. <eos> they built these furnaces so they could dispose of the bodies. <eos> some (if not all) of the nazis seen in this picture were brought to trial for their war crimes against humanity. <eos> here we see the actual pictures of nazis on trial where they were tried, convicted and soon after killed for their atrocities.
"this is what the american seat of power looks like in 2015. this is the goal herr fuhrer. by using our new time warping machine we will influence history to ensure we're sitting in here in the future. <eos> we will build ""the machine"" here. it will make us masters of the universe.  <eos> ""set the furnaces and the factories to work. we must build this"" work begins on the dastardly plan immediately. <eos> the top brass comes to visit and survey the progress. the war isn't going well for germany. ""we need to speed up progress!' <eos> "so, we hear the german are up to something. no matter, we'll just drop an h-bomb on the location. problem solved.
firefighters came to talk with our company to give a bomb safety class after someone made a bomb threat. <eos> our national guard came to sweep the office. <eos> now we are back at work. <eos> while the national guard was there, some of us made friends with them. <eos> now we hang out sometimes.
we visited washington dc. <eos> in the museum was all kinds of old photos. <eos> including some disturbing ones. <eos> there were photos from world war ii. <eos> seeing history is an amazing thing.
me and a few friends went on vacation! <eos> we went to this very nice building, but i cannot remember the name of it. <eos> we went to the hofburg palace, which was very fun. we met a few royals while there! <eos> at night, we hit the town. we went to the bar and had a few drinks. <eos> after that, we stopped at a souvenier store to get some things before finally heading back to the hotel.
the capitol in the town square that we were exploring.  <eos> a few differnt shops that we windowed shopped at <eos> these gnomes were way too expensive <eos> the square is stunning when lit up at night <eos> i wish i had one of those lights in my living room
look at this majestic hotel we're staying at ... pretty impressive.  <eos> before dinner, we decide to go into town to do some shopping.  <eos> we found a great trinket shop and bought some souvenirs to bring home.  <eos> the city buildings are all lit up at night. we really enjoyed our stroll before dinner.  <eos> the restaurant was amazing! look at the decor. the food was really fantastic too.
the family decides to visit an historical landmark. <eos> after seeing the building they head to the streets. <eos> they see many shops with many nice things inside. <eos> then they head over to the church. <eos> such a beautiful city they are visiting.
when i arrived in germany, the weather was a bit cold. <eos> many of the buildings were incredibly ornate , with statues near the entrances. <eos> the palace was beautiful, and very big. <eos> the city was all decked out in lights for the christmas festival. <eos> we went in a store and saw some beautiful christmas decorations.
my trip to the city today was fun.  <eos> i found a really cool area to look around in.  <eos> i found a man walking. he talked to me for many hours about a magical fruit place in the city but couldn't tell me where it was.  <eos> i ventured out to find this magical fruit. i walked for miles.  <eos> i finally found a place and bought one of each fruit and veggie. i bit them all. nothing happened. i am still looking for the magical fruit stand. 
the green murals was not liked by many. <eos> i liked the white mural but did not know what it was. <eos> the letters were done nice. <eos> i also liked all the trees. <eos> the cross was the fan favorite.
we went down to the local market <eos> they had it all decorated for the festivsl <eos> they had bird nest things everywhere <eos> but we were more focused on veggies  <eos> there were tons of everything
it was the weekend farmer's market. <eos> the townspeople began to set up things. <eos> they continued setting up all morning, until things were done <eos> soon the people began to flood in, shopping for fresh fruits. <eos> they all were excited to have the fresh produce.
we are on our way to the outdoor market. a great way to start the day. <eos> love the entrance with the grass and rural look. <eos> lots of vendors and produce to chose from and the street musician to listen to. <eos> mom's on her way to the plant booth to add to her garden. <eos> and now to the food, we'll have a great dinner tonight with all this fresh produce.
i went for a hike last weekend. <eos> we went through the entire forest. <eos> it was very dense. <eos> when we finally got to the village we were very hungry. <eos> the locals made us some food.
they decided to go on vacation to africa. <eos> they stayed amongst the native people from the town. <eos> the houses consisted of shanties, but it was an exciting experience.  <eos> they celebrated with the townspeople at night. <eos> in the morning they toured the beautiful landscape and saw the local wildlife. 
these were some shots i took at the festival last weekend.  <eos> the views from the top were getting better as you got high. <eos> wow what a site. it looked so beautiful. <eos> this was the shack with slept in. it got a little wet.  <eos> the dark time got a little scary. 
the misty mountains looked gorgeous this morning. <eos> and everyone gathered here seemed to truly appreciate it. <eos> this shed was oddly captivating. <eos> and at night there was a tangible sense of excitement. <eos> the next morning we saw tons of really cool animals.
i went with a native to visit the living conditions of a group of people not far from me in this beautiful country i'm visiting. <eos> they've set up camp near the fields they are working. <eos> they have built a central meeting place. <eos> i'm amazed at how social and close this group of people are.  <eos> the work they do is so hard.
we arrived in nepal and immediately were overwhelmed by everest. <eos> we climbed to the nearest peak and decided on our plan. <eos> we decided to head toward the market... <eos> we took pictures, ate, and enjoyed ourselves... <eos> and, then it was time to stock up on supplies--i wanted oranges--for the trip.
a traveler visited seattle and took in the classic sights of the city. <eos> the view of mt. olympus outside seattle was beautifully captured by the visitor. <eos> then a visit to the public market center continued the quintessential sight-seeing tour. <eos> a wall covered with bubblegum showed the quirky character of the area. <eos> a visit to starbucks completed the all-around seattle experience. 
we had a great view of the city. <eos> behind us was amazing mountains. <eos> we went into the city from there to look around. <eos> we explored the area and got to know the place. <eos> we headed to a starbucks to get a coffee before heading out.
this is a picture of the city where we stayed on vacation. <eos> not far from us was this majestic mountain. <eos> this is where we had to park our rental car. <eos> one of the attractions near where we parked. <eos> thankfully there was a starbucks there!
they felt awe and gratitude looking at the mountain. <eos> although it was a grey day, they still had fun exploring the city. <eos> the market bustled with all kinds of people. <eos> they took a photo at a textured gum wall. <eos> then they bought some oranges and made fresh-squeezed orange juice back at the hotel.
we went to the mega flower shop in the city. <eos> many people were hauling in fresh flowers from afar. <eos> a lady is selling some nice orange flowers. <eos> this man has huge sacks full of flowers to sell. <eos> some vendors got creative with how they display and sell their flowers.
visiting india for the summer .  <eos> went to the flower market to see the beautiful flowers.  <eos> a merchant carrying flowers to sell to interested buyers.  <eos> about to by a book to learn the cultures.  <eos> bought different irresistible deserts to try. 
some countries have markets where they sell and trade goods. <eos> individuals come to the market with the goods that they make to sell or trade. <eos> many merchants have started their own businesses. <eos> some make a living on a specific talent or trade. <eos> whatever they have, they bring to the table to acquire needs and wants from other people. since so many people are contributing, it is a good way to make sure everyone has their needs met.
shopping in kolkata is an experience everybody should have at least once. i still remember my first time. <eos> it was packed wall to wall with excited shoppers and wary sellers. <eos> i still don't even know what these are, but i wanted to buy all of them. <eos> i picked up some books that i still don't know how to read. i really should get on that soon! <eos> in the end the only language that mattered was the language of food! it is abundant and delicious. you won't find these at safeway. believe me, i've looked!
a picture of the market from above. <eos> the market is bustling with people. <eos> a man carrying flowers on his head. <eos> some books for sale at the market. <eos> some lovely desserts are available for sale.
i went to a flea market with some interesting pieces. <eos> there were some great vintage boots.  <eos> there were some slightly-deformed cartoon characters. <eos> even santa made an appearance. <eos> but i don't think i want to know what the puppies booth entails. 
university of florida fans come from all over the state to celebrate every year. <eos> hundreds of vendors sell everything you can think of <eos> people bring the strangest things to the celebration. <eos> baby alligators and lots of other unusual things attract thousands of people.  <eos> the local economy gets a big boost from all the visitors. 
what an awesome day to go to the fair.  <eos> we played games and bought t-shirts in between stops.  <eos> there were a lot of fun attractions and things to look at like this little buddy.  <eos> the kids enjoyed watching the live alligators they were pretty cool! <eos> we seen a lot of cool accessories and cheap clothes to buy so we bought a few things. 
we stumbled upon some piece of art: a man and his beer. <eos> boots are the perfect addition to a man's wardrobe. <eos> next, we moved on to more... cutesy pieces. <eos> it's christmas in july, the mother exclaimed. <eos> it seems we made a wrong turn and ended up in the ghetto.
it was a sunny day in gator nation  <eos> we looked for t-shirt designs and saw an opportunity to get one air brushed  <eos> my husband's idea of entertainment was to drink beer instead.  <eos> despite it being gator nation, we can't play with the gators <eos> but it didn't matter because we got ourselves a air-brushed shirt!

yesterday we went to visit the convention center. <eos> there were having many large presentations. <eos> there were a lot of new tech gadgets there. <eos> we got to try out a few of them. <eos> after we were done there we decided to go to the autoshow next door.
people are walking into the convention. <eos> everybody is gathering up preparing for the new technology to be displayed. <eos> the new iphone is displayed showcasing its new features. <eos> new tablets are being displayed and showcased. <eos> a brand new car is being shown as part of the winner of the raffle when you enter.
the conference opens with an announcement of apple tv and the crowd goes wild. <eos> people are roaming about the conference floor to get their eyes on the newest gadgets. <eos> the iphone is encased in a circular shell to protect it as if it is a piece of jewelry. <eos> from the front, we gaze upon its retina display. <eos> a mercedes-benz is shown, with built-in apple connectivity features.
the man and his dog are ready for a nature walk. <eos> they see the splendor of nature on their walk.  <eos> pooch can't wail to go on a walk with his man <eos> they take the time to tip toe through the tulips. <eos> pooch can't believe his eyes at so many opportunities!
it was a beautiful day out with my dog rocko. he was really excited.  <eos> we walked through the park and saw some beautiful flowers along the way.  <eos> this was rocko investigating and being curious.  <eos> rocko also ran around these trees. i haven't seen him this happy in awhile! <eos> sadly, when we got back to the car it looked like someone hit it. luckily they left a note with their insurance information. regardless, it was a good day. 
i went to the park last weekend with my dog. <eos> there were a lot of flowers blooming this time of year. <eos> my dog had such a great time there. <eos> he smelled every flower we came across. <eos> afterward we were very tired and had to go.
a man and his dog, a friendship none other could rival. <eos> venturing through the field, they come upon some brilliantly yellow flowers. <eos> but mark, the dog, spots something in the distance behind them. <eos> behold, yellow and purple flowers that excite mark to no end. <eos> no excursion with one's dog is complete without marking one's territory on some local trees.
today i took my best friend to the park to play. <eos> all the flowers were in bloom. <eos> we spent some time just hanging out. <eos> i got to enjoy the beautiful trees. <eos> then he helped me cross the street home.
it was the day of the big conference. <eos> there were presentations. <eos> yahoo was there. <eos> google was, too. <eos> they were all about preserving the internet.
the conference we attended had a wonderful group of speakers. <eos> sarah miller gave a speech on the importance of balance work and life. <eos> dan johnson's presentation included him dancing a jig. <eos> the conference was packed with attendees. <eos> at the end of the day of presentations, we all took a photo together to remember the fantastic day.
for extra credit for one of my classes, we went to a google forum. <eos> the speaker was rick smith, he was a joy to listen to. <eos> i was also impressed when i saw on stage that ian welms was also going to be a speaker. <eos> but, when i saw george barkley sitting just in front of the google sign and knew that he would be a speaker too, i was just so impressed. <eos> at the end of the forum, they were selling pictures of the entire speakers. i am so glad i went, not just for my grade, but for the knowledge that i left with.
at the convention there were so many people. <eos> the speakers delivered their speeches one at a time. <eos> there were a lot of popular figures there. <eos> it was awesome to see so many important in one place. <eos> afterward all of the presenters went up for a group picture.
the conference was well attended and the audience was engaged. <eos> dynamic speakers presented topics on technology. <eos> executives from yahoo! addressed the audience. <eos> then they heard from executives from google. <eos> after a fulfilling day, everyone knew that they loved the internet even more!
our hotel was not what we were expecting. <eos> we decided to make the best of it with a pillow fight. <eos> we headed out to the market. <eos> i found this which summed up the hotel. <eos> the bed at least was a place to put our heads.
on our way to our new room and saw the funniest little statue. <eos> all set up on our new bed. <eos> tired and ready to go to sleep. <eos> but she woke her up with a pillow fight challenge.  <eos> the next day, they went to the farmers market. 
this is what we saw on our way to get a massage. <eos> amy and i relaxing before we get a massage. <eos> i think amy fell asleep on me. <eos> i had to wake her up with a pillow fight <eos> after we both walked through the town
can't believe the roommate i got stuck with here. <eos> not getting along all that well  <eos> let's start over and see the sights  <eos> stop showing your butt it's not polite  <eos> time to get to sleep long day tomorrow 
the bedroom was very simple <eos> before the pillow fight. <eos> the ladies then went to the market <eos> and saw a funny gnome <eos> before going back home to bed.
the park looks pretty covered in snow. <eos> dang, this happened overnight. look at all that new snow.  <eos> at least they have starting plowing the streets so i can get out. <eos> seeing a fire truck out in this weather is not a good sign. <eos> i am not even attempting to go up that off ramp.
there was record snowfall this year. <eos> everything was covered. <eos> thankfully i got to park in my garage. <eos> it is covered. <eos> i had to walk everywhere though.
this was when my town had a snowstorm.  <eos> the cars couldn't even drive, the snow was so deep.  <eos> all of the businesses were closed due to the snowy weather.  <eos> the firetrucks drove around, and made sure everything was ok.  <eos> the snow was beautiful to see at night. 
it was a spring snow storm. cars were buried in the snowdrifts.  <eos> a snow plow had cleared the street enough to drive on slowly.  <eos> the only place still dry was the multi story parking lots.  <eos> the street lights glowed like miniature suns.  <eos> a street sign showed a green man, a signal that it was safe to cross. but was it, really?
our town was hit with a major snow storm last winter. <eos> the cars could barely drive down the roads. <eos> my town looked like a ghost town during the storm. <eos> the firetrucks were out helping people stuck in their cars. <eos> the snow kept coming even after the sun went down.
an old piano sat in the center of the store. <eos> there were antique dishes and other items. <eos> musical items were popular among shoppers. <eos> many artistic pieces were available at very cheap prices. <eos> vintage images were also favorites.
bob went to a yard sale over the weekend. when he walked up to the house, he saw a beautiful piano outside. he had always wanted to learn to play. <eos> he next came upon a stereo in a glass cabinet. these were very nice items for a yard sale.  <eos> an old phonograph was also there. bob felt he could purchase some of these items to sell for more than he paid for them. <eos> a picture on the wall also caught his eye. that would look good in his bedroom, he though. <eos> last, he considered some old movie posters for his office. he ended up purchasing the piano. 
i discovered this antique shop around the corner from my apartment. <eos> they had so many interesting things from the past.  <eos> one of my favorites to see were the old record players they had. <eos> a photograph hanging on the wall really fit the ambiance of the place.  <eos> as i walked out i noticed even more old advertisements posted on the wall. 
the antique shop had a lot of old things, including this piano, with a copy of beethoven song book. <eos> i found this old betamax player. too bad this machine did not do as good as the vhs player. <eos> i found this beautiful record player to be in great shape. <eos> this old portrait taken in 1928 would surely bring back memories for my grandparents if they saw this. <eos> these old movie posters look better than the ones we have today.
there was the old piano that  <eos> there also was theis amazing radio <eos> my grandma had the same music player that i found in the store <eos> there was also a picture that we found there from the old days <eos> we ended up buying some pictures as gifts
two women pose for the camera. <eos> a bunch of kids are waiting in line while reading the small menu. <eos> a large menu that displays meal prices. <eos> the name of a food truck. <eos> a food truck serving people food.
this is the food court i visited today. <eos> they had spicy food. <eos> they had ice cream. <eos> they had mexican food too. <eos> they even had polish jelly doughnuts!
we arrives early to buy some food. it smelled so good walking up. <eos> every nearby place had their menus set up so everyone could see them. <eos> it took us awhile to pick out what to eat. it all looked delicious. <eos> we decided on a taco truck that had a particularly cool owner. <eos> a lot of other people had the same idea and we stood in line, eagerly awaiting our meals.
good times when we went to food truck expo.  <eos> the kids went straight for the taco food truck.  <eos> the lines were pretty long but the food was worth it.  <eos> we went back for seconds and there were still long lines.  <eos> everyone loved the tacos it was a big winner at the expo! 
people from all over the town came to the food truck festival to try what local food truck has to offer. <eos> these kids are waiting their turn to try some jalapeno sliders. <eos> there is also a booth for homemade ice cream seen at the festival. <eos> the taco truck ready to serve customers some good tasting tacos. <eos> some trucks, like this one, offer different flavors that are so appealing to your taste buds.
last thursday i was playing with my toys when i heard some call my name. <eos> i went over to my mom and asked her if she called me but she said no. <eos> i went to my grandma but she said no too. <eos> my sister also said no. <eos> my other sister also said no. i guess no one called me.
john makes his deliveries to the local market.  <eos> the shop keeper tallies the items he has delivered.  <eos> john them adds up his earnings for the day.  <eos> the shop keeper puts things in order.  <eos> then they wait to open for the day and serve customers. 
upon reaching my destination to journey through the world, i was surprised to find such young people working. <eos> we strolled down the street until we found this vendor selling us some bread for dinner. <eos> it is always interesting to see how other parts of the world treat their elderly. i was pleasantly surprised on this trip. <eos> i was fun to see all the different items that the store owners sold. <eos> but, i just had to take this picture because it was just so unbelievable that someone would be messing with their feet inside the store. oh well, i guess it is ok to do that here.
the guy brought in merchandise to be sold. <eos> a lady was writing down the store's inventory. <eos> another person was doing the same thing at the store next door. <eos> a customer was resting after looking at various things sold at the store. <eos> the seller looked bored since there was no customer coming to the store.
today, i went shopping. <eos> it was a wonderful experience. <eos> i saw all my friends while i was out. <eos> i passed by a lady. <eos> it was a good day
john was 28 when he left his family. he was unhappy with his wife and child and decided to devote more time to his job.  <eos> that was 40 years ago. he now wondered how his wife and child were doing. he did think about them sometimes.  <eos> he considered that maybe his son grew up sad or lonely, selling trinkets in the street to survive. <eos> but then john remembered how happy he was to go off alone, without obligations or commitment. <eos> and he knew, even though he was now an old man, that he had made the right decision to leave.
walking int he market on a sunny and cold day.  <eos> the dad goofy and funny and telling jokes.  <eos> the son was smiling at his dad jokes.  <eos> the mother and the son were getting hungry.  <eos> decided to eat street food and enjoyed it. 
our trip to the festival made us all so excited. <eos> there was an old man there who told us stories from before we were born. <eos> his son was also there, spreading joy with his strange sense of humor. <eos> all around children sat on their parents shoulders waiting for the festivities to begin. <eos> some people got tired and sat as they waited with their food.
during my walk through the town i saw the interesting colors of the buildings.  <eos> dad walked with me too and really enjoyed himself.  <eos> my brother enjoyed the company but no so much the town.  <eos> his wife and child seemed bored by the end of the trip.  <eos> on the way back from our walk we saw a boy sitting there eating his noodles and i wondered if he had a home. 
this was me back in 1967. <eos> i had the world at my fingertips, with a lovely wife and child. <eos> my child wasn't quite as lovely in the 1990's. <eos> sometimes the only was i can really cope is to take a walk and clear my head. <eos> today, i look as old as i feel.
i went to the awards ceremony. <eos> there were many contestants. <eos> only 1 would be able to win the grand prize. <eos> there was a lot of tension. <eos> eventually the winner was announced and he was very grateful.
it was a conference to celebrate the usa team. <eos> the usa team arrive in their jackets. <eos> these shirts were on display and available to purchase at the register. <eos> fans got their chance to talk among the members of the usa team. <eos> the usa team having conversations with the fans.
this is a picture of three people. <eos> this is a picture of a group. <eos> this is a picture of apparel. <eos> this is a picture of two men. <eos> this is a picture of a crowd.
here at a team usa meeting. they are showing the new clothing line for 2015. <eos> the jackets remind me of robocop. pretty nice too. <eos> here is a lighter jacket and tee shirt combination that is really nice. <eos> here are a couple of the designers, give them props for great work. <eos> everyone will be wearing these to the matches.
the group is gathering to present their views. <eos> it looks like everyone is here so we can begin. <eos> it is now time to get together to discuss what was presented. <eos> it takes a lot of people working behind the scenes to make a function work perfectly. <eos> it is time to share with friends what we have heard and learned.
we decided to take a country drive around our village. <eos> farm country is full of rustic charm. <eos> the farmer's market teems with fresh fruits and vegetables. we bought a lot of it! <eos> we were proud to see such art displayed here. <eos> the old architecture is also artistic!
we needed to get groceries today. i never noticed the flooring between these buildings before. <eos> here we are at central market. <eos> fresh cabbage! can't wait to make pigs in the blanket. <eos> snapped this picture remember what was playing at the theatre this week. <eos> i had to zoom in, because i just adore this statute.
there is something about a small farm that i like. <eos> fields of corn and a nice small birdhouse. <eos> the local market has some great looking food. <eos> a statue to watch over the town. <eos> i like these arched windows.
as i continued my car journey through farming country, i spotted a picture perfect farm house.  <eos> it looks like the fields go on forever! <eos> i needed some personal groceries and felt their local farmer's market would be the perfect place. <eos> on my way out of town i saw this statue placed in an alcove on the second floor. <eos> i stopped to see who he was and discovered it to be the town's founder that they have honored. 
i own a four-acre four in sioux city, iowa. <eos> we grow a lot of corn and tomatoes, but also have a good deal of open terrain. <eos> on the weekends i sell our vegetables at a local market. <eos> the market features a statue of iowa's first governor on the outside of the building. <eos> if you look at the building from afar, it's pretty plain.
the museum was my favorite part of the trip. <eos> when you enter it's like another world. <eos> the attention to details can't be missed. <eos> the crowds started to build as the day went on. <eos> closer to closing time though they thinned out.
these people are going to go on a tour. <eos> the painting is very large and beautiful. <eos> the walls are covered in large, beautiful paintings! <eos> there are many chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. <eos> there are paintings that even cover the ceilings!
jack and i went on our first vacation together. <eos> we went to italy!  <eos> we got to see some amazing historical sights. <eos> we visited different places with our touring guide buddies. <eos> we were able to capture some beautiful pictures of the sites.
when i was at the museum i saw a lot great pieces of art. <eos> the entire building was beautiful. <eos> i had a great time there. <eos> it was so pretty. <eos> i took lots of pictures.
the couple took photos in front of the tower <eos> and then saw a giant painting  <eos> before viewing many other paintings  <eos> and even a room with a huge chandelier. <eos> then they went into the most beautiful room of all. 
last weekend we were in the park taking pictures of all the flowers we could find. <eos> there were so many in different shapes and colors. <eos> suddenly there was a lot of noise behind us and then w saw that a street performance was occurring. <eos> we went over to watch some of the talented performers. <eos> it was a great way to end the day.
outside of the memorial park, there was an event going on. <eos> there was a fundraiser in which a lot of people gathered around. <eos> many small activities were going on which involved the whole community. <eos> it was right outside this building right here. <eos> many people passed by, but also looked at what was going on.
it was a beautiful day in the town. <eos> people gathered around to take part in, or watch different activities. <eos> men in white shirts displayed their talent and had a great time together. <eos> nearby people watched everything in awe and had a wonderful time. <eos> after it was over, everyone left to different parts of the town to enjoy the rest of the day.
this is the day we went to see the city's parks. <eos> we saw all kinds of pretty flowers. <eos> we went to see the parade downtown. <eos> there were all kinds of performers there. <eos> this guy was a fantastic juggler there.
i thought it would be a lovely day to visit the botanical gardens. <eos> looks like there is a big celebration going on. wonder whats going on. <eos> oh snap!, it's a live street dance off. i got twenty on the bald guy. <eos> wha-the? i think they just did a twilight dance. everything is in black and white.  <eos> well, looks like we are in the twilight zone. anyone got a paint brush?
i had a hard time deciding what to buy at the market today. <eos> there were many good deals to be had. <eos> i bought some small pumpkins. <eos> i also bought these old bananas. <eos> after that i went back home to eat.
every weekend we go to the market to get fresh food. <eos> here are some of the fresh vegetables that we pick up. <eos> we usually get one bread loaf from the bakery inside of the market. <eos> these pumpkins are so sweet and taste great in pies. <eos> on our way out of the market we always make sure to get some cabbage.
i found a basket of bread today at the market. i had to buy it all.  <eos> i went crazy when i saw a case full of pastries. i had to buy those too.  <eos> mini pumpkins are so cute! i bought 11.  <eos> i didn't know what in the world these dirty black veggies were. i bought 20 though. they smelled like poop.  <eos> i came across a large pile of discounted veggies and i bought all of them. i bought way too much food today. 
there was all kinds of good food at the market. <eos> people were selling croissants. <eos> other people had veggies for sale. <eos> these radishes did not look good. <eos> and the lettuce was also questionable.
i went to a local farmers market today. <eos> i saw many things like bread and bakery. <eos> they even sold pumpkins. <eos> there were also old potatoes being sold. <eos> we ended up buying lots of vegetables.
there is a local street fair that has everything from fur coats... <eos> ... to old typewriters. does anyone even use those anymore? <eos> there is handmade jewelry. <eos> also questionable electronics. <eos> you can even buy beat up old pans if that is what you fancy.
the bazzar was filled with many unique items.  <eos> because of the rain, few people came out. <eos> as the rain cleared it began to get crowded. <eos> steve found a unique stall. <eos> the owner was a crochety old lady. 
i went to the street fair today to find some clothing and other goodies. <eos> i found some antique type writers i just had to have. <eos> and some vintage jewelry for my mom. <eos> i can't believe people were trying to sell their old outdated junk. <eos> one person even tried to sell their dirty, used pot!
i went to the thrift store. <eos> i bought a vintige type writer. <eos> i saw tons of costume jewelry <eos> there were necklaces also. <eos> i bought an old pan!
it is the perfect day to see what everyone is trying to sell. <eos> it has been awhile since we have seen a real typewriter. <eos> there is so much jewelry to choose from <eos> there is jewelry and trinkets for all occasions. <eos> it is also a great place to buy antiques.
the tourists arrived in the city at sunset. <eos> they walked towards the buildings under construction.  <eos> as they passed buildings, the lights came on inside. <eos> they stopped to admire the new construction. <eos> they watched the construction workers do a few final jobs before they went home for the day.
we started our tour looking at the big office building. <eos> after that, we decided to shop for a little while in the city. <eos> once we were done shopping, we decided to tour the city at night. <eos> there was a lot of construction going on near the buildings. <eos> the construction continued throughout the night.
as the sun was setting yesterday i knew i was really far from the restaurant. <eos> i wasn't entirely sure where it was but i decided to walk around and see if i could find it. <eos> it began to get very dark. <eos> once it was night time it made it a lot harder to see. <eos> i gave up trying to find the restaurant and went home instead.
surely a roman catholic church with that architecture. <eos> this view isn't all that attractive. <eos> the world is winding down as the sun departs over the horizon. <eos> as evening begins to creep closer, the city begins to look even better. <eos> there's always construction of new, modern buildings going on.
i had a wonderful day with my family. <eos> we went out in the town. <eos> it was so much fun. <eos> at night i went out to the club with my friends. <eos> we danced all night long
at the festival people brought fresh foods of all sorts. <eos> i came specifically for the banana breads, which are always baked to perfection. <eos> then there is the cubes of fudge that are quite a delight. <eos> and the freshest, juiciest, strawberries one would ever see and taste. <eos> mama's table was my last stop, her jams were the best in the city.
walking through the farmers market and saw a merchant selling soap.  <eos> getting several organic soaps.  <eos> radishes to make soups.  <eos> mushroom for the pasta sauce.  <eos> and fresh strawberries for a strawberry sorbet.
the man set up his food stand at the farmers' market on saturday. <eos> he brought with him a wide assortment of things, including fresh breads. <eos> he set up a fudge counter, something he had recently branched out into. <eos> he also had some fresh strawberries he got from his son's garden. <eos> but the centerpiece was the jams and jellies he had long made.
yesterday i headed to the farmers market to browse the food. <eos> there was delicious fresh baked bread. <eos> there was also an assortment of various candies. <eos> the strawberries were freshly picked. <eos> i wound up purchasing a jar of fresh jam.
the man was organizing his cheese <eos> that he had a lot of. <eos> he also had other vegetables like pototoes <eos> and mushrooms <eos> as well as strawberries.
the state put out a tornado warning to the citizens. <eos> tornados started forming overhead. <eos> people started panicking and running towards their shelters. <eos> the winds got crazy and the clouds rolled in. <eos> rain turned to flooding as people scrambled for safety. 
the weather forecast told us that we were going to have a tornado in the evening. <eos> the tornado touched down over our neighbor's house. <eos> we decided it wasn't too dangerous to go outside and take some pictures. <eos> the rain clouds were thick all over the town. <eos> some of the roads below sea level even flooded. luckily enough no one was hurt.
these maps show where all the major storms were. <eos> a large tornado touched down. <eos> everyone in the neighborhood was in fear of losing their homes.  <eos> as you see, the clouds were very dark and sinister.  <eos> they brought heavy rainfall and flooded roads. 
local tornado map is not looking good. <eos> here is a photo of the tornado that is coming close. <eos> we were worried about the close proximity of the tornado <eos> more bad weather for the weekend <eos> road is closed due to flooding
when i first saw the tornado warning i didn't believe it. <eos> it wasn't until i saw the tornado with my own two eyes that i was absolutely terrified. <eos> it only lasted for about five minutes but those five minutes felt like an hour. <eos> fortunately, the tornado did not do significant damage. <eos>  but not long after the tornado the flooding started and our town was under siege again.
after the blizzard everyone was ready to make snowmen <eos> this bridge got really icey and a few people slipped. <eos> at night the town was glowing. the light from the streetlamps was bouncing off the freshly fallen snow. <eos> by the morning time the roads had mostly been cleared off. <eos> the lake stayed frozen for weeks afterward, though.
on a snowy day, the family decided to go to the city park. <eos> it was a long walk to the park. <eos> the park was beautiful . even the bridge was covered n snow. <eos> all of the trees were heavy with fresh snow. <eos> the family built a snowman and had a lot of fun.
"snow fell in the town of makeawish today! <eos> children and elders flocked to the park to play in the snow. <eos> a group of children hid under the bridge and pelted pedestrians with snowballs. <eos> almost everyone tried ""sledding"" down the hill in cardboard boxes. <eos> "at the end of the day, this cute snowman was left as a solitary lonely guard over the empty park.
somebody made a nice snowman and put a hat on him <eos> walking in the snow covered park <eos> night time the city look beautiful <eos> this old stone building is quite charming <eos> waking up to this white sheet of snow in the morning is priceless
we went to the big city in the winter and saw a gorgeous snow city. <eos> we made tracks in the snow on a romantic walk. <eos> we found a breathtaking bridge with snow covered on it. <eos> the snow on the trees was awesome to see in the park. <eos> we spent a few hours building a snowman and putting a hat on him.
a father with his daughter and son. little did they know he would come out as gay later that night. they are no longer on speaking terms on account of their conservative christianity. <eos> four asian people posing for an image. they are all related.  <eos> an older man with his younger wife. she will later divorce him for infidelity.  <eos> a man with his wife. they are honestly boring because they do nothing wrong <eos> a sexy young woman in all black. she is on the prowl for richer older men. 
i had a great time meeting new friends last night at the business party. <eos> there were a lot of people that were very nice. <eos> some of them were very rich. <eos> they all had nice things to say about me. <eos> i am glad i attended the party.
the party was a lot of fun for everyone invited. <eos> old friends reunited together and made new memories. <eos> john, who was the class clown, had become a top physiologist at a university. <eos> claire and amanda had not seen each other in ten years and were overjoyed to spend time together again. <eos> casey, who was unsure of her future, had become a top fashion designer in new york city.
i went to a wedding last night, <eos> it was so much fun. <eos> i talked and dance with friends all night long. <eos> it was such a beautiful ceremony. <eos> i'm so happy for them.
i was invited to this dinner by my boss. i had to go so i wouldn't look bad. that's him, david the lucky bald guy. <eos> these are his parents and brother. i honestly don't know where david came from. they were so sweet. <eos> this is me getting someone to take a selfie of me. i'm dressed pretty sharp and wanted to remember it. <eos> here is one of david's friends on the right and gina from accounting on the left. she seems to be enjoying herself. <eos> this is donna, the office secretary. i've always had a huge crush on her. maybe i'll ask her out tonight.... after a few more drinks!
here is the reception area before the bleed blue sales and marketing event. <eos> as we filed into the auditorium this is what awaited us. <eos> everyone was excited for the event to begin. many people were wearing bleed blue shirts. <eos> it was informative and fun. the enthusiasm on stage was infectious. <eos> here i am with new friends and old colleagues.
everyone is excited for the annual meeting. <eos> the chairs are all set up with the proper paperwork. <eos> the presenters are ready and have their powerpoint pulled up on the screen. <eos> the huge crowd of people is seated and ready. <eos> finally the presentation is done and the crowd goes wild. it was a great conference.
here we are, a throng of professionals amiably making small talk in the lobby.  <eos> the day's programs were conveniently looped over our seats for perusal before the first speaker.  <eos> as the attendees gathered in the room, the energy level rose considerably.  <eos> of course, we had to endure the requisite cheesy skit.  <eos> however, the event was a success overall, and many new friendships were forged. 
the event was expected to be a huge success.  <eos> and if the designated seats were any sign, there was a big day ahead.  <eos> the speakers were all absolutely outstanding.  <eos> one side of the audience loved what the saw <eos> and the other side likes it so much they gave a round of applause. 
everyone was arriving to the cvent kick-off. <eos> as the attendees walked into the theater, they took their seats that were adorned with usa today papers. <eos> the kick-off's presentation wa a big success. <eos> at the end of the presentation, everyone in the theater clapped. <eos> they very much enjoyed the kick-off.
this was a very unique trip. i didn't go inside but had to grab a picture. <eos> one shop we went into had lots of old toys. <eos> some things were a little weird and i didn't know what they were. <eos> these guys were from a famous tv show. <eos> i came home with a funny puppet.
walking in an adult only store.  <eos> tintin and captain haddock with their astronaut gear walking in the moon. <eos> huge floating statue in the sidewalk. <eos> on my way back home saw the cutes couple walking hand in hand.  <eos> a cute yorkie on the side of the road. 
the family decided to visit the anime expo in our city. <eos> we saw props for a new anime series based on astronauts. <eos> the theme for the anime expo seemed to revolved around space and astronauts. <eos> we took a picture of the walk we had to make back to our car.  <eos> on our way back to the car, we found a puppy running on the sidewalk. 
i was out walking downtown last night. <eos> i went to the museum to see a lot of interesting pieces. <eos> some of the decorations outside were very whimsical. <eos> after it started to get dark i began to head back. <eos> i saw this dog on the street and took it home.
the museum had a lot of art <eos> and sculptures that  <eos> were quite random in shape. <eos> they came in all sizes and <eos> would surprise you by what they looked like.
we went on a little shopping trip to a local market. <eos> there were great deals all around. we weren't the only people interested in going. <eos> they had watermelons sold whole or by halves that looked delicious. <eos> they also hd these coconut looking things that seemed weird. <eos> there was single serve portions of some weird looking food but we had to try it!
the open market was just that open. <eos> all the stuff is available to sample. <eos> they want to make sure that what you buy is fresh. <eos> they set up booths all along the road. <eos> you can try many unique food items.
my buddy tim is a delivery driver in a foreign country. <eos> he goes around on his scooter and makes deliveries to food vendors. <eos> last week he had to deliver a bunch of watermelons to a guy. <eos> more common is grapes or figs, which are easier to carry. <eos> the best in when he gets to deliver prepared food for good tips.
my ship visited izmir, turkey and i was able to go ashore. <eos> i traded duty with another fellow so i could spend extra time seeing the sights. <eos> i tried their watermelon, and while it was good, our melons in georgia are sweeter. <eos> everything seemed so colorful as i walked about. <eos> this shop was a little like a delicatessen and offered pistachios, oiled olives, cabbage pickled in beet juice and sliced peppers.
a tour of the far east always has its crazy moments. what exactly is this guy selling? <eos> fruits are easy in these parts and so is travelling - apparently. <eos> whose up for pumpkins? they are for eating and not just for decorations - so the locals say. <eos> more fruits and the folks here look a whole lot younger. coincidence? <eos> condiments ahoy!
jen took the train into the city. <eos> she walked towards the market through the city. <eos> she chose some snacks to serve at her dinner party. <eos> she waited on line for some fancy cheese. <eos> she paid for her groceries before heading back to the train station.
shopping in the city sometimes requires a bit of a commute. <eos> however, one gets to experience city life as they run their errands <eos> some people can make shopping a hassle. <eos> while others are simply in the same boat you are. <eos> but it is all worth it in the end to get to stuff your face with your favorite food.
this was my first day and my first ride on a subway and my roommate told me she would take some pictures of me in the city. <eos> i got off the subway and just stared at all the buildings. <eos> i thought i would go to some stores and low and behold there was someone doing something weird, it made me just stare. <eos> i see that there are some elderly people shopping here too. <eos> they asked me to try a few things and i am telling you it tasted horrible. i shouldn't have opened my mouth with food in it, but i couldn't help it.
i took the subway to downtown last week. <eos> i went shopping. <eos> there were a lot of cool items to try out. <eos> i met some interesting people while i was there. <eos> afterward we got a bite to eat and the food was really hot.
i like riding the train into the city <eos> when i get to the city i always do lots of shopping. <eos> i love to get food there  <eos> it's so good and tasty. <eos> and the people are always so nice.
we kicked off our day of sightseeing very early. <eos> it was so early that city was deserted. we later found out it was a holiday. <eos> we strolled through many shops and were tempted to purchase too much. <eos> this was our wonderful meal at the end of a long day. <eos> we splurged on a foot massage back at the hotel while planning the next day of walking.
a woman uses a pay phone in town just for the fun of it. <eos> she comes across a spa and gets a pedicure while she reads. <eos> after her pedicure she decides to have some lunch. <eos> finally a stop at the local museum with some very creepy art work. <eos> this artist captures the essence of human beings well.
crystal is new in town and looking for something fun to do. <eos> she searches through different catalogs to see what she can do. <eos> she grabs a bite to eat and then locates a nearby museum with a lot of artifacts. <eos> crystal came across one that caught her eye, a caveman and a log. <eos> next to the caveman was another, he looked so sad trying to build a fire.
katie had saved for years for her trip to the faraway eastern city. <eos> she stayed at a large hotel in the heart of the downtown. <eos> she had brought a lot of money to buy local goods, and she fell hard for this tree trunk chair.  <eos> she insisted on eating every meal at authentic local restaurants. she didn't like the food much, but she wouldn't admit that to herself. <eos> at night in the hotel, she browsed her many travel booklets to decide what to see the next day. she was determined this would be the trip of a lifetime.
the young college student was visiting the city. <eos> she saw some beautiful buildings. <eos> she also visited an art museum. <eos> then she had dinner. <eos> she ended her night relaxing and reading.
our trip began with a trip to the market. <eos> we found a large produce stand. <eos> then, we bought some baked goods. <eos> afterward, we gathered with the locals in the town square for a festival celebration. <eos> our evening ended with a carriage ride back to our hotel.
we loved the food markets along the streets of europe. <eos> there were fresh meats and sausages made on the premises. <eos> the baked goods smelled so wonderfully we had to make a purchase. <eos> we splurged on a horse drawn carriage ride on the city streets. <eos> the beautiful lights made us want to stay awake all night!
there were so many sweets to eat at the market, i wanted to buy them all. <eos> there were also healthy options that looked just as good. <eos> it was hard for me to take my eyes off the sweets though. <eos> afterwards, we took a walk into town to see the lights. <eos> there were even old cars that zoomed down the streets.
you wouldn't believe the quality of the meets at the strip market in town.  <eos> and the product is so fresh and ripe.  <eos> i went just the other day and spotted a new bakery.  <eos> the streets were crowded with people which did not surprise me.  <eos> i decided to splurge and took a chariot ride back home. 
yet another visit to the local farmers market <eos> lots of different selections here, does not help my diet <eos> this is where the sweets are sold <eos> an old horse drawn carriage bring the nostalgia <eos> city lights at night time looking fabulous 
we went on a tropical trip. <eos> at one point we got up close to some monkeys, and got to see some people play with them. <eos> the monkeys also enjoyed to play with each other. <eos> after watching the monkeys we had to have a light lunch. <eos> we enjoyed the rest of the day by the beach watching the sunset.
welcome to angullia beach house resort! <eos> the tourist is hungry. <eos> he sees the two monkeys. <eos> here. let me catch them and cook them for you. <eos> here's your monkey dumplings!
i visited asia last year and got to stay in a hotel that was built on stilts. <eos> nearby lived a man who trained monkeys for a living. <eos> the monkeys would fight each other for their own amusement. <eos> later i would get some traditional food in small dishes. <eos> i would walk down to the river and sit and watch the sunset.
when i was on vacation i had a very unique experience. <eos> i got to play with many monkeys while i was there. <eos> they were very mean and took most of my food. <eos> i had little to eat while i was there because of the monkeys. <eos> after i left i was glad and i don't want to see anymore monkeys.
the retreat had many tall trees <eos> and monkey that needed to be fed.  <eos> after feeding they played <eos> before the adult had some food too <eos> and enjoyed the great view of the water.
it was such a nice day today, so i took a ride into town. <eos> i saw some decorations down the road, so i went to go investigate. <eos> i found a nice little farmers market and bought some fresh fruits. <eos> i sat and relaxed under a giant shady tree, and ate my fruit. <eos> i saw a stray cat relaxing on the pavement, and gave the cat a piece of food.
today we went for a long drive by the water <eos> there were many beautiful scenes <eos> including this one if the rock wall <eos> we then decided to see the other side of the rock wall <eos> and ended the day going to the market on the street 
when i was on vacation last week i had a great time. <eos> there were a lot of events going on while i was there. <eos> the castle i stayed in had a huge wall. <eos> there was no way i could climb it. <eos> there was a great market nearby with lots of fresh goods.
this the view of the streer on our trip <eos>  we saw ow people hang their clothes to dry here, <eos> the street is filled with street vendors <eos> this wall was one of the oldest walls here. <eos> we saw a black cat, we were careful it didn't cross our path.
there was not much traffic <eos> near the house with fish. <eos> but the market had a lot of people <eos> and pretty trees that were green. <eos> many saw the cat that was nearby.
we made it to the town. <eos> first stop was to purchase russian dolls. <eos> she made sure to get her henna tattoo this time. <eos> the kids played on the splash pad. <eos> the adults enjoyed wine and cheese.
this woman is about to get her first henna tattoo. <eos> first her arm is cleaned so the henna will adhere. <eos> the artist begins with the basic structure of the tattoo. <eos> then, she goes back through and adds details. <eos> the tattoo is finished!
before my friend's wedding, i went into the city to see a tattoo artist. <eos> she unrolled my sleeve and prepared my arm for the artwork. <eos> she started drawing a simple branch. <eos> then she added leaves to the long plant. <eos> finally, she made a drawing of a plant running up my arm.
this is before i start to get some art on my arm <eos> i am a little nervous, but i out out my hand anyway. <eos>  the artist starts to draw a design. <eos> it is a long stem with leaves, so far so good.  <eos> the end result was just what i wanted. this was great.
the old bridge was visited <eos> by someone that had a lot of dolls <eos> and a vine tattoo on their arm. <eos> after they visited the fountains <eos> before eating a nice meal of cheese and grapes.
we stopped at this one little restaurant on our way to the city.  <eos> the sandwiches were very good.  <eos> the building just seemed to glow at night.  <eos> after the visit to the city we stopped for some beers.  <eos> this was the view from the ferry on our way back to the hotel.
after walking for hours on our tour, we wanted to sit and relax. <eos> we started with a few beers and didn't want to leave. <eos> no that's not his beer. my son was playing waiter. <eos> as usual, we got hungry after drinking a few. the food was greasy but tasty. <eos> a photo-op by the water before heading back to the hotel.
the restaurant was full of people waiting to eat great tasting food.  <eos> the guys got together to get a quick pic together. <eos> the building looked classic with the light's reflection beaming from it.  <eos> they has such a great time, and the beer was great.  <eos> seeing the colorful lights made the night worthwhile.
the three of us went out the other night and had a blast.  <eos> the hand made brews were to die for.  <eos> even this little kid thought so.  <eos> the food wasn't bad either but i preferred the brews.  <eos> on the way back we got a couples photo with the dark waters behind us. 
we sent to the city for the weekend. <eos> we ate the local food. <eos> the lights shining on the water were brilliant. <eos> the food and beer were delicious. <eos> even in the fog the city looked majestic. 
the local bazaar opened today complete with yummy seafood. <eos> it was fun to browse the hand woven baskets. <eos> we looked through all of the colorful musical instruments. <eos> there is so much color here i felt i needed sunglasses! <eos> bikers came for miles to be part of this event.
i went down to the market to buy some seafood. <eos> after that we bought some sheets. <eos> i also stopped to see if their wicker baskets were any good. <eos> we went to grab a ride on the bus. <eos> when we got off there was a beautiful motorcycle parked nearby.
i went to the market place today and had some lobster. <eos> i bought a basket to carry some home. <eos> i then went around shopping and saw scarves. <eos> there were also some that looked colorful and see through. <eos> i went home on a motorcycle.
i went shopping at the farmers market today with my family. <eos> i found a whole bunch of baskets for crafting. <eos> i got my grandpa a unique walking cane. <eos> my daughter really wanted a tutu from one of the shops. <eos> my husband found a blue motorcycle he's considering buying too.
there are many things at the market. <eos> i love the basket assortment. <eos> there were many scarves to choose form. <eos> look at all the bright dresses too! <eos> i rode home on my motorcycle.
the buildings were so old in town. <eos> even the streets looked old and different than what i am used to seeing.  <eos> they had a lot of little stands with fresh fruits for sale. <eos> they had a large variety of foods to choose from.  <eos> they all looked so good and fresh.
the locals traveled the streets to get to the market. <eos> it was located in an old, but trendy part of the city. <eos> there was much fresh produce to be sold. <eos> many browsed the baskets looking for the right goods. <eos> the items were inexpensive to purchase.
we decided to get out and photograph this beautiful city.  <eos> the narrow alleyways are so surreal and charming. <eos> the markets were amazing and with fresh fruit  <eos> there were stands lining the streets.  <eos> and so many fresh vegetable stands. 
i love the architecture of the old city <eos> the streets are narrow and everyone drive small cars <eos> local food is very good and very inexpensive <eos> all organic fruit and vegetables <eos> fruit and vegetables were cheap and delicious
the family was taking a stroll through the old part of town. <eos> the buildings were tall and close together. <eos> their were stands all over selling fresh produce. <eos> the stands stretched all the way down the street. <eos> we bought some peppers and pears.
the village was small but quaint. <eos> the snowy hills brought many tourists. <eos> they enjoyed hiking and other activities. <eos> the early evening provided a beautiful view. <eos> some paths were cleared for those who didn't like the snow.
the view from the top of the mountain was breath-taking.  <eos> you could still see some rock in between the snow.  <eos> mom wanted a picture of herself up top.  <eos> it seemed the mountains just went on forever.  <eos> the water was so blue and still. 
from the vantage point of the village, the mountains don't look cold and uninviting.  <eos> but the presence of snow becomes obviously as you hike to a higher altitude.  <eos> once you're at the top, though, the view is gorgeous - it makes a perfect backdrop.  <eos> but you quickly get overwhelmed with the sense of how vast the range is.  <eos> i felt much more comfortable closer to ground. i'm more of water person, anyway. 
the snow had melted off of the houses.  <eos> the mountains were very tall. <eos> she stopped for quick photo with the mountains in the background. <eos> the snow was endless for miles to come.  <eos> we cleared a path to be able to walk safely upon. 
we visited alaska this summer and loved every minute. <eos> a visit to denali national park was the highlight of our trip. <eos> here's morgan posing in front of a huge glacier. <eos> the rivers were full of spawning salmon and other fish. <eos> the best part of our journey was the near solitude we had in the wilderness.
shoppers arrived early for the market. <eos> there was a variety of goods sold. <eos> some carried away large bundles. <eos> every item was fresh and colorful. <eos> the spot was a favorite among produce shoppers.
it is very early in the morning. jin is cleaning the open air market grounds. soon the sellers will be arriving.  <eos> the sellers arrive on motorcycle and bicycle carts with fresh produce and meats to sell.  <eos> melons will be a popular item for sale today.  <eos> the sellers take time to array the items for sale in a decorative manner. <eos> soon the customers will arrive and the market will be busy. 
the men were clearing the back of the store.  <eos> the sellers were transporting their goods from one area to the other.  <eos> the watermelons were juicy.  <eos> the chicken was plentiful and juicy. <eos> the vegetables and herbs were fresh. 
the market is getting ready to open. <eos> people are starting to arrive to sell their wares. <eos> this man is excited to sell his beautiful melons. <eos> he sells right next to a guy who sells chickens. <eos> there are delicious smells all through the market thanks to this man's cooked food.
the market was flourishing on a sunday afternoon.  <eos> fresh produce was piled on itself.  <eos> the watermelon vendor arrived a little late. <eos> some of the fruits were oddly shaped. <eos> i called a taxi and left after shopping for a while. 
went on vacation and found a great flea market. <eos> while on vacation we found much shopping in the way of flea markets. <eos> we had lunch at this pub to rest our feet after shopping. <eos> what a lovely b&b we are staying in, <eos> we found another pub close by an had this lovely dinner.
the shop had interesting collectibles. <eos> it was located in an old historic building. <eos> there was colorful seating in the back. <eos> a plaque denoting the street location was present on the building. <eos> posters were popular among patronizers.
we went to a fabulous flea market with all kinds of treasures. <eos> the flea market was filled with interesting items galore. <eos> nearby, the bull inn was a quaint and beautiful place. <eos> this old building was also beautiful and looked like it had many secrets. <eos> we also ate a wonderful breakfast of sausage, eggs and other wonderful foods.
when traveling around the flea market can be a great tourist attraction. <eos> you find all kinds of old items you have never even seen before. <eos> flea markets can often be surrounded by other buildings that draw attention. <eos> even old buildings with tall tales can draw attention when traveling. <eos> and what better way then to start a day then to sit back at fine restaurants and eat a hearty breakfast.
while we were in europe we visited several flea markets. <eos> they had unique stuff for sale. <eos> we stayed at the bull inn. <eos> the building looked ancient. <eos> we had a full english breakfast.
this was my favorite bottle of wine we encountered <eos> this is the room where we had our wine tasting experience <eos> there was a shelf filled with some of the best wines they had to offer <eos> everybody was enjoying their drinks <eos> there was a beautiful view from outside the window
my friends and i went on a trip by train. <eos> while on the train, we decided to go to the dinning car. <eos> in the dinning car, they had a wonderful selection of local wines. <eos> we each grabbed our glasses and the wine we wanted <eos> and sit down to all have wine together. that train ride was so much fun!
our train ride last weekend was amazing! <eos> the dining cart was very elegant for a train.  <eos> and the wine choices were incredible.  <eos> i felt like royalty as we dines with the landscape rushing by out the window.  <eos> before it was over i had a lady snap a picture of us but our attentions were drawn at the last minute and she took side views. 
we had a lovely dinner at a nearby winery this weekend. <eos> their dining room is in an antique railway car from the 40's. <eos> the wine collection was sublime. <eos> the view of the vineyard added to the enjoyment if the meal. <eos> we met other couples and had a good time chatting with them through the meal.
travel by train to the vineyard.  <eos> you will enjoy luxury dining in the all new dinning car.  <eos> there is also wine tasting on board.  <eos> enjoy your favorite glass of chardonnay.  <eos> a glimpse of beauty through through one the large windows. 
the city's buildings were unique. <eos> there were remnants of older structures on the corners. <eos> small markets sold fresh goods. <eos> the produce was especially popular. <eos> night time was filled with entertainment.
we took a trip to a town for vacation. <eos> we first stopped by a farmers market where they had all these fruits and vegetables for sale. <eos> at night, this city becomes lit up by so many lights. <eos> it feels great to walk around in a busy city at night. <eos> we stayed for a couple of days and then we went to the train station to catch a train home.
during my trip i actually saw a huge outdoor hot bath! <eos> we then went to the market and got some fresh produce.  <eos> we walked around until dark.  <eos> the streets seemed empty after dark so we went back to our room.  <eos> the next day, it was time to get back on the train and go home. 
not much has changed in this charming city. the buildings are old.  <eos> there are old-fashioned phone booths still hanging around.  <eos> the markets are set up in an old fashioned way.  <eos> they sell fresh fruits and vegetables.  <eos> yet, there are still modern-looking areas of the city. 
there were a lot of old buildings. <eos> there were old phone booths as well. <eos> the market had vegetables everywhere. <eos> you could pick whatever fruit you wanted. <eos> then when it got dark the streets became mostly empty. 
it can be hard to see, but it is important to remember and learn about apartheid history. <eos> learning to juggle and sharing stories for all generations. <eos> the market has amazing arts and crafts that also highlight the culture. <eos> it is so pretty with calm quiet places like this tree-lined road. <eos> there are reminders of the pain, though, with fences like this left in place.
you come down the road through this neighborhood. <eos> in this house, a mother is juggling inside the kitchen. <eos> two old women, on the outside deck, also try to juggle. <eos> a look of one old woman juggling a green and blue ball. <eos> a look of the second old woman juggling a green ball.
our day started by visiting a new museum. <eos> clara played with a bouncy ball to work her dexterity skills. <eos> south africa hosts many good markets. <eos> the street is devoid of cars and all is quiet. <eos> the embassy features steel spikes so no one breaks in. 
my grandmother lives on a pretty, quiet street. <eos> there's always a lot going on at her house. one day we all tried to juggle! <eos> my grandmother wasn't bad. my mother wasn't as good. <eos> my grandmother was putting on quite a show by the end of the day. <eos> my mother barely could throw the ball in the air.
we visited the apartheid museum over the weekend <eos> locals here are really good juggling balls in the air <eos> this is the local crafts market where you can find work by local artists <eos> streets were quite empty today <eos> nicely crafted fence, looks more like a work of art.
the diner was a popular spot for locals and tourists. <eos> a cup of coffee was a favorite item among customers. <eos> the wait staff was friendly. <eos> the seating was cozy but roomy. <eos> the exterior was as unique as the menu.
here you see the small restaurant off the side of the road. <eos> inside you can see that a seat is open to be seated.  <eos> or you can seat here and order items more quickly. <eos> first you get is a drink, like tea or coffee. <eos> afterwards you can order meals, like these if you brought two extra friends with you.
we ate at the best breakfast cafe the other day.  <eos> the coffee was delicious! <eos> the lady who made the coffee was really nice and didn't mind us taking photos.  <eos> i can't believe it wasn't busier.  <eos> on the way out i took one last snap shot of the outside and went home full. 
we saw an old-fashioned diner and decided to stop. <eos> the inside was even more old fashioned than the outside.  <eos> we sort of felt like we stepped back into the 1950s. <eos> the coffee was good. <eos> the breakfast was amazing. 
the new breakfast club is now open for business.  <eos> inside you will find bright, cheerful booths.  <eos> along with a friendly staff, you will receive first class service.  <eos> it's been said the coffee is the very best.  <eos> stop by today and enjoy a hearty breakfast.
the make-up team arrived to get ready for the fashion show. <eos> they got to meet some fun people. <eos> the models looked great! <eos> the talented make-up artists did a great job. <eos> the fashion show was a big success.
some of the aveda workers smile for the camera. <eos> a aveda worker sitting in front of the camera. <eos> a different aveda worker pose for the camera with a visitor. <eos> the same worker but by herself posing for the camera. <eos> four aveda workers posing for a picture from a different camera.
workers with aveda salons went to the beauty pageants. <eos> they did the contestants hair and makeup. <eos> the contestants looked great in their dresses. <eos> it was a great experience. <eos> the beauticians were proud of the contestants.
the committee meeting had a great turnout. <eos> veronica was there and i haven't seen her in a year. <eos> the professional photographers snapped pictures of everyone. <eos> i look happy because the event has good food. <eos> the night ended with a beauty pageant and it was very pleasant.
the stylist team are all smiles after getting the ms usa pageant contestants ready to walk the stage. <eos> kim smiles for a photo with ms. lisa toledo for a photo before her walk on stage. <eos> four contestants get a quick photo op in before the big walk. <eos> kim takes a quick selfie before taking her seat to watch the beautiful ladies walk. <eos> all of the ladies look beautiful thanks to the talented stylist. they walk across the stage proudly as they introduce themselves.
we took the ferry to the market to enjoy the scenery. <eos> at the market we first stopped by the dairy aisle. <eos> next we got so meat and poultry for dinner. <eos> afterwards we stopped by the cafãƒâ© for a quick bite to eat. <eos> then we took another ferry back home.
the building looked like s church. <eos> but inside was a restaurant. <eos> they had hundreds of pastries. <eos> the variety of meats were abundant. <eos> they had enough seating for our group.
i visited a city and walked up and down the water. <eos> i found a really great bakery with lots of pastries. <eos> in the same building was a meat and fish vendor. <eos> there was a central cafe where we could all eat our purchases. <eos> the building it was housed in was gorgeous.
our day begins with a short ride on a water taxi. <eos> we wander the aisles in search of some delicious fare. <eos> there is much to choose from. <eos> we take time to sample some of the local food and rest our feet. <eos> heading back we remember another satisfying day.
the old building had a green roof  <eos> and was near a lady that sold hats. <eos> the market was not full of people <eos> but had many meats for sale. <eos> the restaurant was waiting on the people from the market to come. 
it's festival time in a small town in taiwan.  <eos> a local school has been picked to play music while people gather.  <eos> taquin and sodu are sisters that play the clarinet.  <eos> their other sister siki plays the tuba.  <eos> there are a lot of fun treats to enjoy while listening to the talented orchestra. 
staring the day at the music festival. <eos> the bass player was a crowd favorite. <eos> the girls on clarinets were lovely. <eos> the saxophonist put all her heart into it. <eos> my favorite was the flutist with her enchanting melody.
my mom came to my orchestra concert that was held in the park. <eos> i got on stage and played the bass like a champ. <eos> my friends got their woodwind section going to join me. <eos> at the end, my friend marnie began to play the baritone. <eos> my cousin bobby enjoyed the treats he was given.
i went to the festival today. <eos> there were a lot of people performing. <eos> the orchestra was very good. <eos> some of the musicians were very talented. <eos> i had a great time there.
she was very excited to get a good seat that day.  <eos> the band members had brought their instruments.  <eos> these two girls were nervous about their performance.  <eos> this girl was quite confident.  <eos> the flutist had a solo that day. 
breakfast started out well. <eos> this was a gourmet syrup. <eos> it was purchased here. <eos> it looked appealing. <eos> the results were delicious.
these waffles look like a great choice for breakfast. <eos> oh no! the only syrup i have seems to have a bad cork so i'll need a fresh bottle. <eos> luckily, there is a shop just down the road from my apartment. <eos> they have a wonderful selections of syrups to choose from. <eos> now i can enjoy my breakfast waffles with fresh syrup.
i was hungry this morning so i decided to make some waffles. <eos> i began cooking them. <eos> while i was out i went over to the store to buy some more ingredients. <eos> after i was done i went back home and finished cooking my waffles. <eos> they were delicious.
i could not believe we found eggos on our trip. <eos> we were able to find maple syrup too. <eos> most of the stuff was kind of hidden at the store. <eos> yes we had waffles for dinner. <eos> my brother could not wait to eat.
john got hungry so he grabbed a box of eggos <eos> john also got thirsty so he poured himself a cup to drink  <eos> john went to the store to look at something to drink <eos> john poured the syrup on his eggos <eos> john finally took a bite to eat of his eggos
man i'm so hungry. let's get some food. <eos> haha dude we're sooo high. <eos> let's get some soup for some food.! <eos> can't forget alcohol. better turn up today! <eos> time to check out the food.
i work at a grocery store, some may think it's lame but i love my job.  <eos> i don't have to waste my time making extra trips after work to go shopping because i can get everything i need from work.  <eos> my boss is great and makes me laugh. <eos> the store even carries my favorite brand of soup, and look at that price, what a deal! <eos> after a long day of dealing with customers, this tends to be the isle i visit for a nice relaxing evening at home. 
i had to go to the grocery store yesterday to buy some food. <eos> they had a lot of items on the shelves. <eos> i had a great time laughing with the employees. <eos> it was all very cheap. <eos> afterward i went to buy some beer.
today i visited a new market to look for some unique foods. <eos> the workers got along great and had a nice relationship. <eos> the soup wasn't on sale this week like i had hoped. <eos> there were so many choices of beer that i couldn't decide what to get. <eos> the store manager gave me a discount on some chips and i was on my way. 
the shopping market did not have many people <eos> but the cashiers were very happy. <eos> the soup was cheap <eos> and there was a lot of beer <eos> so customers finally started coming in.
my vision board for today was full of ideas. the first one was to not fail!!  <eos> to leave hyde park because i can't ever find my way out of there.  <eos> to commit to things because i never have.  <eos> smile all! i want everyone to smile!  <eos> the last one was the magic of friendship. one day i'll make a friend!
i spent all day yesterday writing notes to everyone in the office. <eos> i put a lot of quotes. <eos> and funny jokes. <eos> and some inside jokes. <eos> everyone had a great laugh.
the kids dream is to get a phd,  <eos> this one is to reach their highest potential,  <eos> this one wants to climb a rock wall.  <eos> then this guy wants to master league of sc,  <eos> and this guy simply doesn't want to fail.
he made a board for them.  <eos> there assignment was to post their dreams on it.  <eos> their ambitions.  <eos> their goals.  <eos> since it was anonymous, a few left pranks. 
two office coworkers sent notes to each other. <eos> they were playful and sometimes cute. <eos> one of them had really nice handwriting. <eos> they did this every day and i noticed they blushed when they read them. <eos> if i recall correctly, they always meet in the bathroom after reading each others' notes.
the protest was downtown this morning. <eos> many people of all races and sexes were in attendance. <eos> news crews from all around were there to report on the event. <eos> several groups carried banners in support of the cause. <eos> the entire protest was very peaceful and effective in my opinion.
going to the protest in california. <eos> black and gay we are family protesters. <eos> black and gay here to stay sign. <eos> legalize gar marriage sign. <eos> put a ring on it sign, for gay marriage.
it was a beautiful day in sunny california. <eos> a perfect day to head out to a gay pride parade. <eos> everyone was happily displaying their signs as they marched. <eos> everyone was marching for equal rights.  <eos> it was a perfect day and a peaceful march. 
a pride parade occurred in my hometown.  <eos> hundreds of people made their voices heard.  <eos> kalene interviewed a lot of people that day. <eos> there were inexpensive banners being held up. <eos> a lot of creativity went into the parade pride signs.
today is the day of the big march. we are really excited about it! <eos> we got all the friends we could to join in and people came from other towns as well. <eos> the local tv station interviewed us. <eos> different groups joined in. there was loads of us. <eos> some of the banners were home made but really got the point across. a great day.
the morning before the protest, the streets were empty. <eos> fences were put up to keep the peace. <eos> slowly, people started to make their way to the designated area. <eos> there were many there who supported marriage equality. <eos> while others felt strongly about traditional marriage values.
there were not a lot of people on the street today. <eos> i walked for a while. <eos> there were a lot of people at the corner. <eos> they were having some kind of rally. <eos> i decided to go with them.
we took a train into the city for the rally. <eos> it was to be held tomorrow but preparations were already underway. <eos> here we are walking to the heart of the protest. <eos> the crowd was passionate yet peaceful. <eos> the turnout was huge thanks to social media.
i decided to take a stroll around town to enjoy the rest of my day. <eos> it seems that the town was calm and collective <eos> until a group of angry protesters swarmed in.  <eos> protests in the form of speeches and marches were flooding the street. <eos> in addition, a vast majority of people were advocating a health care reform.
the plaza was empty <eos> when the lights lit up. <eos> people started to come <eos> to protest against the laws  <eos> of healthcare.
we visited washington, dc for the fourth of july this year. <eos> there were a lot of people commemorating veterans. <eos> there were throwing flowers every place. <eos> it was kind of nice to see flowers on the ground everywhere. <eos> i took the opportunity to snap this picture of the washington monument because it's iconic.
washington is a beautiful place <eos> there was a memorial for those lost in the bombing <eos> flowers were laid where people died from the blast <eos> many family members came to leave respect <eos> there was alot of people there
i went out for a walk today. <eos> they were having a memorial service at the capitol. <eos> there were many flowers there. <eos> everyone had come to show their respects. <eos> there was a large turnout.

today we all gathered together to help clean the school outside. <eos> we shoveled up leaves <eos> and planted some soil for flowers in the summer. <eos> after we took a selfie. we were still in our coats because it was still cold. <eos> after all the parents chatted with some coffee.
there was a lot of work to do. <eos> we had to restore the nearby park to acceptable condition. <eos> we filled the wheelbarrows with wood chips. <eos> we only had one wheelbarrow so some people had to carry them in buckets. <eos> when we were finished the children were very excited to play in the park.
the garden at the local park our school volunteered to work on this weekend.  <eos> we had to do a little heavy lifting early in the morning on the weekend.  <eos> do not say that teachers do not work on the weekend.  <eos> the kids where so happy to take a break and have a snack.  <eos> at the end of the day everybody was happy to be in the warm school. 
half the community showed up to help set up the new park. <eos> adults and children both came to lend a helping hand. <eos> it was a cold day, but everyone helped carry in the mulch.  <eos> the kids had a lot of fun making a difference.  <eos> it was a good afternoon to spend with friends for a good cause. 
we decided to do a service project fo rthe school. <eos> we put mulch down for the playground. <eos> then helped build it. <eos> the kids were really excited. <eos> they couldn't wait to play on it.
today we taught a classroom of kids  <eos> they came to learn about science and insects  <eos> as we taught they were listening intently  <eos> i thought they would never stop asking questions  <eos> little denny just sat there and took it all in !
the parent teacher conference started with a dramatic reading of hamlet by one of the parents. <eos> mr. wu played the part of horatio to perfection. <eos> the children were a captive audience. <eos> i decided to read an excerpt from dr. seuss as well. <eos> the children were so well behaved that i deigned to reward them with a little treat.
we started today with story time. <eos> our teacher showed us the pictures in the book while she read to us.  <eos> we love story time so i always look to get a good spot around the table and close to the book.  <eos> after story time the assistant teacher started a new lesson with us.  <eos> it wasn't quite as fun as story time. 
the class gathered around their teacher during the experiment. <eos> the kids were excited to see how the experiment would turn out. <eos> the children waited patiently for the resukts. <eos> there was a discussion afterwards about the experiment and what it meant. <eos> the kids were exhausted, but very interested in the whole procedure. 
teaching children about other cultures can be fun.  <eos> mr lee came to our 4th grade class and taught the children about growing up in china.  <eos> even though a lot of the kids there were chinese they had been born in the us and really didn't know a lot about it.  <eos> cynthia sat down and read some stories afterward, telling the children more about china.  <eos> and then everyone pigged out on the treats mr. lee brought the class. 
"time for a parade to let everyone know that we have dreams. <eos> even the sororities can come out to show they have dreams. <eos> i am apart of this dream having group and i am proud. <eos> these 2 men are letting everyone know, ""we have dreams!"" <eos> "the whole neighborhood has finally joined in and could not be happier to let everyone know that we have dreams!
there were many people at the rally yesterday. <eos> they were blocking traffic on the street. <eos> i had a great time there. <eos> i brought a sign with me. <eos> after the sun started to set i went home.
black history month started with a parade at my local college. <eos> the sororities came out in support. <eos> the small parade went down the main street. <eos> they headed towards the college campus, on their way to see the speaker. <eos> "they carried a sign with the words, ""i have a dream"", to remind everyone that they were still fighting for racial equality."
the memorial march took place in the winter. <eos> there was a great turn out of organizations. <eos> a lot of groups showed up late. <eos> they still made their presence known. <eos> dr. kings memory still runs strong.
there was a rally in town on martin luther king day. <eos> our sorority joined in. we have quite a few african american sisters. <eos> it was a better turnout than last year. <eos> we stopped at town hall and waited for the mayor's speech. <eos> it was a very positive experience and martin luther would've been proud.
i went to visit the capitol the other day. <eos> i took my daughter with me. <eos> we spent a lot of time at the parks. <eos> we were sight seeing all day. <eos> we got really tired of walking everywhere.
the whole family went on a trip to washington d.c. to see the sights. <eos> my daughter and i sat on the steps to the memorial. <eos> grandpa might not have seemed very happy, but he was glad to be there. <eos> the wife needed some time to rest her feet on the steps after a long day of walking. <eos> on our way out we even saw some kind of protest going on.
we had a great time on our trip to washington d.c. <eos> we did all the tourist sites and took the mandatory pictures. <eos> some people came prepared for a picnic. <eos> others just relaxed beside the water. <eos> we chose a bench under a shade tree to sit down and discuss what fun we had that day.
a father and daughter took a picture together in front of a monument while on their family vacation. <eos> the two of them continued to take pictures together in front of other historical sites. <eos> after they had finished taking pictures, the family went to the park for a picnic and lunch. <eos> then they walked around the washington monument area. <eos> some of the family members were tired from the sight-seeing and so they rested on the park benches for a while.
on our trip to d.c. stopped off for some reflecting. <eos> got to see the lincoln memorial. <eos> granddad was ready to march with his union. <eos> mom thoroughly enjoyed the reflecting pool. <eos> the march went off without a hitch. we all had a great time and got our message across.
dave insisted on going to the museum this month. <eos> the reason was because it was having a photo exhibit of the civil rights movement. <eos> he took his time examining each photo. <eos> all of them were pristine in black and white themes. <eos> before he left he made sure to check the upcoming programs so he would know when to come back.
the museum was almost empty when i arrived.  <eos> i approached the photo exhibit of the historical march. <eos> the sign had a lot if information that i did not know. <eos> i was in awe of what these people had done. <eos> the exhibit filled many rooms. i want to go back again.
the gallery is having some photos that will be seen. this person in a motor scotter has already looked at them. <eos> the photo exhibit sign displays what is to come. <eos> a man is looking in depth at some of the amazing photos. <eos> one of the photos displays the movement from the 60's for all african americans. <eos> more programs are to come and here are some of them on the board.
i visited a museum today. they had an exhibit on civil rights. <eos> the sign said it was from the march on washington d.c. <eos> a man was standing in my way, so i waited till he was looking. <eos> once he moved, i walked over to see all of the historic black and white photographs, depicting civil rights marchers. it was quite interesting! <eos> there was a sign that mentioned there being more to come at a future date.
there were many photos  <eos> at the exhibit. <eos> the lady was looking at them <eos> and saw many people in them <eos> before looking at the upcoming program.
the group of people approached the monument.  <eos> they took time to really study it. <eos> they thought about its implications and discussed them with each other. <eos> they enjoyed the intellectual conversation. <eos> after about an hour, they decided to go back the way they came, leaving the monument behind them but fresh in their memories.
i went on vacation last year. <eos> i saw a really old statue. <eos> it was magnificent. <eos> i bought some flowers for it. <eos> i left them there.
the statue was amazing.  <eos> the tourist were excited to finally be able to see it.  <eos> the structure was built decades ago.  <eos> they took a picture in front of the statue together.  <eos> the landscape complimented the statue's appearance. 
the statue was very monumental. <eos> we were the only ones there but we did noticed that someone had placed a wreath there before us. <eos> my brothers decided to stay near the wreath while i walked around. <eos> we all met back there 10 minutes later but no one showed up. <eos> we decided to leave after 30 minutes.
this monument is huge. <eos> we look in amazement. <eos> we talked about the statue in great depth. <eos> we are so small compared to the monument. <eos> the water was so clear but yet looked blue.
they gathered early to start getting work done for the big game. <eos> the owner even showed up to check in on the progress. <eos> they brought in boxes of all the supplies they would need. <eos> the event coordinator was pretty impressed with the workers. <eos> they ended the day with a meeting to discuss where to go from here.
the participants of the leadership conference were encouraged to bring non-perishable food for donation. <eos> some of the donation items before everyone arrived. <eos> one of the speakers talks with an attendee during a break. <eos> lunch is served at the halfway point of the day. <eos> a team building exercise after the speaking was all done.
the job corp had many young people working for them. <eos> they collected food. <eos> the spoke to sponsors, <eos> and they did a trial run before the actual food giveaway to get to know each other. <eos> overall, the meeting was a success and they were ready to volunteer for real.
the neighborhood trash pickup day started without a hitch. <eos> everyone worked their hardest to do what they could. <eos> even the mayor came out the show us his support. <eos> it was rough out in that cold, but we managed to do our best. <eos> the after party was also tons of fun.
the group arrived for a volunteer conference. <eos> some of the people took time to meet with the organizer. <eos> they prepared the conference to be able to handle a large crowd. <eos> some helped direct the people where to go. <eos> when everyone arrived, they broke into groups for an exercise.
the event was held in the meeting chambers at the department of agriculture building. <eos> it began with the color guard, the pledge of allegiance and the invocation. <eos> opening remarks were made by the head of the alpha phi alpha fraternity. <eos> an expert panel was on hand and each took turns addressing the audiences questions. <eos> it was standing room only and everyone enjoyed the presentation.
a public debate was starting, and it seemed to be starting off well. <eos> each side had their chance to give an introduction to their argument. <eos> the opposing side choose their words carefully. <eos> while members of the guard stood still holding flags, and weapons. <eos> the room was packed with people eager to hear what the two sides had to say.
this event is for fraternities to help develop leaders and great men. <eos> the uniformed men have come together in support for this cause. <eos> the speaker is one of the main advocates for the event. <eos> the people on the stage ate discussing important things. <eos> quite a number of people showed up to show their support for the event.
last week, we had a panel of speakers come to our school. <eos> it was a very important affair. <eos> the speaker talked about human rights. <eos> there even was a panel discussion. <eos> everyone in the audience listed with awe at this wonderful gathering.
this is a panel discussion. <eos> this is a picture of a man making a speech. <eos> this is a woman making a speech. <eos> this is a group of military personnel.  <eos> this is a picture of the audience.
today was the day. <eos> everyone was there. <eos> including the cops. <eos> but that didn't stop us. <eos> our voices would be heard.
traffic was heavy.  <eos> the stop light had stopped working.  <eos> someone called the police.  <eos> the policeman got out to direct the traffic by hand.  <eos> one driver paid no attention and caused an accident. 
"the last bit of traffic filtered through the streets. <eos> in just a few minutes, the road would be blocked off to make way for the protesters. <eos> the police, enforcing the right to free speech, used their suvs to block traffic so the protesters could take to the streets. <eos> ""down with the banks!"" they chanted. <eos> "though one man used the opportunity to tell a different story.
today there was a protest. <eos> lot's of people came. <eos> there was police there as well. <eos> people stood outside with signs. <eos> it was a chaotic day.
there were many cars on the road <eos> and they were all bunched up <eos> because the police came <eos> in their van  <eos> while the people watched what was going on.
a lot of people came out to hear the faith testimonies on sunday. <eos> the reverend gave a wonderful sermon about faith, hope, and love. <eos> everyone wanted to say good morning. <eos> the reverend was happy to oblige. <eos> he was very obliging when the students wanted their picture taken with him.
students gathered to listen. <eos> the speech was interesting. <eos> the first lady spoke. <eos> they paid attention to what was said. <eos> it was a full house.
everybody showed up to the town meeting tonight. <eos> people spoke about their opposition to pet control. <eos> others spoke about how they were in favor of it. <eos> everyone was paying the utmost attention. <eos> the crowd was split and will go to a vote next week.
there was an equal rights conference at the nearby court house earlier this afternoon. <eos> some of the city's top officials spoke and gave their opinions and thoughts on the subject. <eos> there was also a meet and greet. it was nice to actually talk to them instead of always seeing them on the local news. <eos> i'm glad i was able to make it out. it was a very interesting and informative time. <eos> equal rights is vital to our freedom as citizens and i'm glad a lot of our local leaders are on board in pushing for it.
the students gathered to listen to the presenters give lectures. <eos> there was several presenters on hand to speak. <eos> they spoke to the crowd with new ideas. <eos> the students listened with interest. <eos> some of the students took notes as the presenters spoke.
some people watched our march from their work place. <eos> people in the restaurant showed their support. <eos> even the children participated. <eos> we crossed the last street on our route. <eos> a lone bicyclist closed in the ranks at the end.
one day he was driving down the street while a parade was happening. <eos> but little did he know, a guy riding a bike was trying to run up on his car and wipe him out. <eos> it was a happy and joyous day. all smile and no tears. <eos> this is papi chulo, he is the thuggiest thug out there. <eos> as the guy was approaching papi chulo's car a bus hit him. this is the bus.
local business owners took a break to watch the demonstrators march by. <eos> they carried signs. <eos> they brought their children. <eos> they marched past a church. <eos> one person rode his bike instead of walking.
the chefs were getting made fun of <eos> while they held signs. <eos> people were protesting  <eos> and blocking the streets <eos> from the bikers.
everybody was out, ready to watch the parade even the workers.  <eos> the people in the restaurant were even ready to see it with their prime seats.  <eos> the children walking the route were so happy to be included.  <eos> the first part of the parade had passed the restaurant. <eos> a man on a bike starts the second part of the parade. 
a bomb exploded in london. the cop is keeping onlookers out. <eos> the area is roped off to the public. they are making sure everyone is accounted for. <eos> the news crews have arrived and set up across the street. <eos> their vans are blocking the road. <eos> today's paper has the blast on the front page.
the people came to protest against what this person was doing. <eos> they marched the streets. <eos> they would no longer stand for it. <eos> they tried to get others to side with them. <eos> they waved banners and flags as they marched.
the area is being cautioned off for the event. <eos> people are setting up, and gathering around. <eos> there is even a place to get out of the sun. <eos> all of the news groups are there to cover everything. <eos> it was even announced in the local newspaper.
the security guard is standing guard over the upcoming presser. <eos> reporters are now gathered waiting for the presser to begin. <eos> they have set up tents for their organizations. <eos> the satellite trucks have arrived and are awaiting the presser. <eos> a reporter gives us a view of the latest newspaper headlines.
the news wa on the street.. <eos> there had been some sort of crime. <eos> the cops put yellow tape up. <eos> people were at the scene. <eos> everyone was curious what happened.
the tree cutter went to work. <eos> the men supervised. <eos> the tree was getting cut. <eos> he took the top off.  <eos> it was a job well done.
christmas is near and these guys want to put lights on the tree. <eos> this is the tree they want to put lights on. <eos> the firefighters came out to help. <eos> the guy is helping with the lights. <eos> this guy climb to the end of ladder to finish putting up the lights. now the community would enjoy a brighter city for the holidays.
we had the fire company come out the help with the christmas lights <eos> everyone came to help out and get it ready <eos> we used big bulbs so they would look better  <eos> the trees were gigantic so we needed big ladders <eos> the fire truck ladder was especially useful 
my husband helped out putting up the towns christmas tree.  <eos> it took all morning just to get it into place.  <eos> they had to call the fire dept in for back up to help raise it.  <eos> my son could care less about the big tree.  <eos> my husband got to climb the fire truck ladder and fix the top of the tree. 
it was almost christmas and we had to decorate the tree. <eos> the people on the ground made sure i was secure. <eos> i tried to hang the ornaments but it was too far away. <eos> i finally got a good reach to the top of the tree. <eos> i was aided with the help of a firetruck.
"on my way to the military function today i saw this. ""do the bad thing."" it got me thinking about the devil.  <eos> is the devil in one of these men wearing red coats? i stared at them studying them all one by one.  <eos> i didn't see the devil in any officers either. i watched the men lined up. no devil here.  <eos> i got to see firsthand and up close the soldiers in their dress whites. it was a great show and still no devil here.  <eos> "the music later on that night was so much fun. we sang and danced and had a great fun time. i forgot all about my mission to find the devil. 
roger headed to dc to see some of the sites there pwere too see. <eos> he took this picture of the capital building. <eos> he was very amazed by the capital building it was a memory he will never froget. <eos> he the seen some soldiers who were protecting the capital building. <eos> he had to have one last shot of the building before leaving.
we decided to try and solve the mystery of the do the bad thing! <eos> they suggested that we go and look over to the left. <eos> these guys did not want to participate at all in the quest. <eos> after the mystery was solved these men got an award for exposing the truth. <eos> then everyone celebrated at the great concert party.
far off places are always interesting to visit. <eos> you get to meet new people and have a good time. <eos> even our military gather around the cities. <eos> there are shows that are played for the visitors. <eos> the night is followed up with a concert in the park.
the trip to the capital started with viewing monuments. <eos> the capital building looked impressive on this sunny day. <eos> many people enjoyed the weather and sightseeing.  <eos> there was a military gathering.  <eos> a military demonstration was organized in front of the capital building.
sometimes you have to go out in nature. <eos> take the road less traveled. <eos> look out on the green pastures <eos> appreciate the green trees. <eos> and sit down by the still waters and take a breath.
maicey thought it would be a good idea to take the left side of the trail. <eos> we ended up on riverbed completely lost. <eos> after an hour of walking we made it to a main path. <eos> we could see that it lead to civilizations. <eos> we ended up in an old english town with square buildings. 
we are going over the bridge to go for a nice hike. <eos> it is very relaxing traveling under the shade. <eos> the fields have so much space, it is a great place to run around. <eos> we are getting pretty deep into the forest now. <eos> we have finally reached a stream of water, hopefully it is alright to drink.
it was a great day to be outdoors. <eos> a nice quiet stream. <eos> the road led them so many places. <eos> a fantastic bridge. <eos> such a quaint area.
the countryside was a beautiful lush green. <eos> the water was still puddled from the storm, <eos> this bridge took us over the river and to the trailhead. <eos> this is a view of the bridge from below. <eos> the houses were old and so charming with their brick facades!
it's amazing looking at the water  <eos> standing in your favorite location  <eos> watching boats race or slowly chug by  <eos> but it is amazing the strength of the cables  <eos> and structures of the bridges over the water 
we started our scenic walk down the golden gate bridge. <eos> we took a few minutes to gaze and enjoy the view of the bay. <eos> there were many others there enjoying the view as well. <eos> we were joined by a little bird friend. <eos> no better way to end the day than a trolley ride to the city!
these were from our trip to vista point last week. <eos> here she is! the view was so breathtaking.  <eos> i wanted to grow swim in the water but my wife wouldnt let me. <eos> i would not want to fall from that height. <eos> the bridge was so pretty and fun to walk on
that is the san francisco sky line at the point of my middle finger.  <eos> on our way up to the golden gate bridge.  <eos> a view across the bay at san francisco.  <eos> looking up at the top of the golden gate.  <eos> it is even more magical once you are on the bridge than you would think. 
we made our way to the golden gate bridge.  <eos> we stopped at a vista and looked out to the bay.  <eos> other people were watching the boats below from the bridge.  <eos> we saw a bird fly down in front of us.  <eos> we even saw a trolley pass by. 
the security guards made sure the streets in the town were clear for the parade to begin. <eos> veterans walked in groups <eos> based on the military force that they were apart of. <eos> as the sound of the snare drums went off, the commander general began to make it appearance. <eos> it was easy to tell that he was impressed about the special event for veterans day.
the mayor announcing the guest speaker. <eos> the streets were completely block. <eos> presentation of arms. <eos> the american legion playing drums. <eos> the girl scout walking in the parade.
today we're having our annual high school parade.  <eos> everyone will attend, this is the boy scouts alumni. <eos> here comes our high school band, best in town. <eos> these are our famous drummers, they are very good. <eos> here are our speakers for this years parade.
a cop just taking it easy making sure nothing goes wrong. <eos> the service men are ready to march. <eos> here they come starting the parade off. <eos> next is the drummers playing a song. <eos> now it is dedication time and thank all the men and women for their work.
no one cared about the parade, so police assistance was lax to say the least.  <eos> the marchers in the parade took everything seriously.  <eos> unfortunately, no one came to watch them.  <eos> the only feedback was from someone living nearby complaining about the sound of drumming.  <eos> the mayor began to give a speech, but when a breeze came by and blew it away, he had to improvise. 
every forth of july our motorcycle club gets together to celebrate.  <eos> always willing to pose for any picture if someone ask us to. <eos> mom and dad as proud as ever of me to i might at, i think. <eos> there urging toward us to get a big photo of the whole club finally paying off. <eos> even snapping a few pictures of the jackets and shirts in the back to boot. 
i love to travel <eos> this place is amazing <eos> so much to see <eos> and do <eos> i will return
today we all gathered around for the 4th of july biker rally. <eos> here we are all grouped for the group photo. <eos> this nice couple stopped by to compliment my bike. <eos> we took some more photos of the crew to remember the event. <eos> afterwards, we sat around for a while deciding where to eat.
bikers saluting the flag and getting ready to take off. <eos> here is a good one of the gang. <eos> here i am with my husband. <eos> along with some of my relatives that came along. <eos> taking it easy and getting some rest.
the motorcyclists gathered for the fourth of july celebration.  <eos> they proudly posed with their bikes.  <eos> this older couple have been coming to the celebration for years.  <eos> this group of friends posed together for a photo.  <eos> these three kicked back and enjoyed the show. 
when life gives you lemons.. make lemonade out of it. <eos> that what i did. <eos> at first i was quiet about it. <eos> until i met this guy. i love this guy <eos> . now i am a open and proud about being gay
the family gathered around the grill to celebrate. <eos> we had some shrimp skewers to cook on the barbie. <eos> jimmy was having a little too much fun. <eos> caroline kept on trying to feed blazer everything she was eating. <eos> jeff stole the camera and took some pictures of himself.
we invited some people over for a barbeque today. <eos> we made some kababs. <eos> after that we had a little alcohol. we made margaritas! <eos> the kids were distracted with the dog. <eos> after a few drinks i took a quick bathroom selfie.
all of friends and family were at the house. <eos> various foods were prepared for dinner. <eos> everyone was having a great time. <eos> the kids and animals bonded. <eos> i even felt like taking a selfie.
i was cutting some lemons for lemonade. <eos> my friend stopped by to see what i was up to. <eos> i told him i was making lemonade. <eos> he thought that was strange for some reason. <eos> then we went to the gay pride parade.
there was a cookout with friends <eos> and family met up for some stories <eos> and the kids played together <eos> the parents loved seeing the babys <eos> it was a wonderful day for kids and adults 
mike arrived with the salmon and steaks. <eos> he got right to work on grilling everything just right. <eos> the kids sat in the driveway slurping icees and playing games. <eos> ruby decide to be a little frisky for the camera. <eos> brandon seemed to have gotten into the ice cream, a fact which he solemnly denied.
picnic day with the family, this is gonna be fun. <eos> here i am grilling these kids up some hot dogs. <eos> the kids are so well behaved, patiently waiting for the food. <eos> well, some of them are well behaved lol. <eos> he's too cute, he loves my cooking.
friends and family came over for the cookout. <eos> dad was on grill master duty. <eos> the kids were entertained with games with one another. <eos> silly faces were made by the toy tube. <eos> the meal ended with ice cream (though some wore it on their face).
miranda smiles at me before the party began. <eos> the daddies had a little discussion before the party. <eos> miranda makes a silly face for the camera. <eos> saul holds his baby so she can see the activity. <eos> the children waited with excitement for the singers to arrive.
a fence alongside the river. <eos> a beautiful waterfall nearby. <eos> two children horseplay along the riverbanks. <eos> an insect on a leaf. <eos> a young boy strikes a pose.
we took the kids on a nature walk <eos> we had such a good time <eos> we found a dam <eos> and a stream with a bridge <eos> as well as some wild flowers
we took the at risk youth out to a field trip closer to nature. <eos> we took them to see waterfalls. <eos> these two brothers are part of the program and play a bit too rough for our tastes. <eos> we took their attention away from their violent play and towards vegetation.  <eos> we don't think the trip was a success.
i love to travel <eos> this place is amazing <eos> so much to see <eos> and do <eos> i love this place
nature walks are a good way for children to get exercise and learn about the world around them.  <eos> rushing, falling water can teach them about gravity, waterflow, inertia and speed. <eos> they can even learn from man made structures meant to control water. <eos> a calm body of water will let them explore wildlife that inhabit the water and surrounding area.  <eos> they can even learn about local flora. 
everyone came over for our yearly thanksgiving meal. the kids had been playing most of the day. <eos> bill and susan couldn't stay awake long enough for supper. <eos> finally the meal was ready everyone gathered around the table. <eos> bill was falling asleep all throughout supper. <eos> once he was so tired his head fell into his soup.
we arrived at our beach house late at night. <eos> i was there with my family. <eos> in the morning, we walked on the shore. <eos> here are my mother and sister walking around. <eos> the view from the shore was beautiful.
we took a look at the beach in the night air. we were to excited to wait till morning to see the beach! <eos> we got to our hotel late, it was beautiful. can't wait to hit the beach tomorrow. <eos> waking up to smell of the ocean air and sounds of the waves, is something we will never forget. <eos> we posted this pic on fb and all our friends liked it.  <eos> we are definitely coming back here again!
i love to travel <eos> this place is amazing <eos> so much to see <eos> and do  <eos> i love this place
taking this trip to the beach, was the best idea ever. <eos> the light illuminating the water way was tranquil.  <eos> the water had receded just enough to see the beautiful sand. <eos> a closeup of us all together, just having a blast. <eos> a memory for the books.
one day we decided to take a hike through the forest. <eos> eventually we got to a road and followed that instead. <eos> there were some animals along the side, including some cows. <eos> we also found a farm that had some goats. <eos> soon we were back in the forest, hiking again.
the tree branches here had a weird green color to them. <eos> there was a big gate to keep the cows in. <eos> here we stopped and found some pretty flowers. <eos> this is the farmhouse where the animals are. <eos> and here is some of the goats that were inside.
we had been in a drought recently. <eos> but it finally rained. the road is damp. <eos> and the cows are enjoying the fields. <eos> these babies want to come out and play. <eos> this is some of the damage from the drought. tree roots are really exposed.
deep in the forest in a far away land, the trees were exceptionally straight.  <eos> there was a secret road.  <eos> and a magic cow.  <eos> the magic cow had a two headed calf.  <eos> only one man knew where it was or what its magic could do. 
in the forest, hidden almost away from view was a large patch of land owned by a local farmer. <eos> there wasn't any indication that anyone lived on the land, that is unless one discovered an old gate leading to the property. <eos> amongst the field there were also beautiful wildflowers that lined the fence and the farmer's property. <eos> once inside, one would come to a large building that seemed abandoned on first glance. <eos> however, if one were to venture inside they would find an array of different livestock and animals. 
today we rode our bikes to the beach. <eos> the traffic wasn't too bad. <eos> we went to watch the seals sun themselves on the beach. <eos> one of them preferred a little privacy on a rock by himself. <eos> the littlest one decided it was time for a swim.
the three of us decided to go on a bike ride  <eos> we rode for hours down all the neighborhood streets  <eos> we rode down to the stream  <eos> then stopped to get our photo taken  <eos> after that we rode yo the beach and took a long walk 
we are taking a bike ride over to the shore. <eos> the rode has it's own bike lane which is nice. <eos> we finally made it over, and there are seals all over beach. <eos> the rocks are very close to the shore on this side. <eos> it is fun watching the seals swim around the beach.
the family riding our bikes and getting exercise. <eos> look at us go, i hope i don't wreck. <eos> the seals were on the beach getting some sun. <eos> some of the stayed in the water. <eos> they are going back to the water where they belong.
mother and sons prepared for their bike ride. <eos> they wore helmets and traveled in the bike lane to the beach. <eos> at the beach they saw seals sunning themselves. <eos> some of the seals went for a swim... <eos> and some of the seals made a splash!
this year i went home to spend mother's day with mom and grandma. <eos> i gave my mom a homemade greeting card which she simply adored. <eos> mom got some of her favorite gum as a gift. <eos> i also got to spend time with the cat. <eos> we had a delicious strawberry pie after dinner.
everyone got together for mother's day. <eos> three generations sat at the table for a big lunch. <eos> then it was time for a delicious cake. <eos> after that they gave each other mother's day cards.  <eos> finally the cat got some attention to during the visit.
grandma was ready for the day. <eos> after her nap, she sat down to eat with her family. <eos> after their meal, they had some cake. <eos> after cake they passed out their cards. <eos> when the day was done, they relaxed for the evening. 
the family gathered for mother's day.  <eos> this woman received a card.  <eos> she also got a sears gift card.  <eos> afterwards they played with the cat.  <eos> they ate delicious strawberry cheesecake after dinner. 
i've always been good at gift giving, but my grandmother's 90th birthday was tricky aside from a meal with her friends.  <eos> i figured a homemade card would be nice. <eos> but the actual gift stumped me, and all i could think of was a gag gift and a gift certificate.  <eos> i think she was just happy to see me, all young and full of joy.  <eos> her neighbor was nice enough to make a cake, but due to a variety of dietary restrictions among the others, i was the only one who took a slice.
we threw granny a big birthday party. <eos> mom came and got a photo with gran. <eos> a lot of family showed up for the party. <eos> we met some new people too. <eos> grandpa even came and hung out with the younger women.
we all gathered at grandma's house for her birthday. <eos> we hadn't seen each other in a while. <eos> it was great to catch up with the cousins <eos> and aunts. <eos> we celebrated with cake and laughter.
the whole family came out for grandma's birthday <eos> grandma's eldest daughter traveled from afar to be there.  <eos> the grandkids were there with their mom too. <eos> even the next-door neighbors showed up to celebrate grandma. <eos> many generations gathered and had a good time. 
mom had received lots of gifts on her birthday. <eos> geoff and mom posing for a picture together. <eos> geoff and amy making funny faces for the camera. <eos> geoff, terry, and amy posing for a shot. <eos> julia, geoff, and terry together again.
grandma annie's birthday was sunday.  <eos> she was really happy that her grandson jack was in the area and made it to the little gathering.  <eos> jack is a pro wrestler and is quite the villain on tv.  <eos> but here was family, he was just one of the guys.  <eos> and everyone seemed to love him, heel or not. 
a old man was sitting at his house.  <eos> his daughter visited him and showed several interesting pictures from her last trip.  <eos> there was a lot of unusual fish sculptures.  <eos> they were pretty amusing and funny. <eos> even places these fishes located were strange. 
grandpa has been doing art for the last 50 years. <eos> he loves to make huge pieces out of wood.  <eos> he has been working on several fish sculptures. <eos> the local bank bought one to place near their wishing pond. <eos> my favorite is on the one in his yard. it reminds me of fishing with grandpa.
for the day we prepared to take our dad to an outdoor out exibit. <eos> before he went he finished cutting down his tree. <eos> when we got there we saw a fish that was painted to look like an airplane. <eos> then there was one that had flowers painted on it. <eos> my favorite fish was one that was just randomly painted.
today i'm going to see my son's art.  <eos> it says it's all over town, let's go. <eos> oh my! this is mr. limpet, beautiful! <eos> ok, our son is a little bit on the weird side but we love that about him. <eos> here is one that hangs around the top of the town, i love this!
jim is an artist, but not your regular kind.  <eos> he creates some amazing lawn sculptures.  <eos> some have even been on display in art galleries.  <eos> and a lot are on display all the time at office buildings.  <eos> he even has one here in our local park. 
two young girls are dancing in the pavilion. <eos> the adults gather together in front of the pavilion for a group photo. <eos> the flower girl and young bridesmaid pose for a picture with some adults. <eos> four happy guests smile at the photographer during this happy celebration. <eos> the bride poses with some of her friends to mark the occasion.
the reception was a lot of fun today! <eos> we ate a lot of fruit and snacks! <eos> the girls danced in the gazebo and looked very pretty in their dresses.  <eos> we took some family photos to show the beautiful day! <eos> the smile on her face captured the wedding day perfect!
everyone was excited after the wedding. <eos> our sister snacked on fruit at the reception. <eos> the flower girls danced around the gazebo. <eos> after they settled down we posed for a picture. <eos> we caught a closeup of my sister by surprise.
the sisters had a great time on easter sunday. <eos> the whole family came together. <eos> the girls took a picture with their grandmother, aunt, and uncle. <eos> even the twins made it to the event. <eos> it was great to be around the whole family.
the flower girl and mini bride play in the gazebo. <eos> family and friends pose on a summer day. <eos> friends of the bride pose for a photo. <eos> parents and grandfather and a friend smile on this happy day. <eos> the bride in white posing with friends and family on her wedding day.
we attended lilac sunday in the park. <eos> there were a variety such as this white. <eos> the bush was huge and smelled wonderful. <eos> there was the usual lilac colored lilacs. <eos> there was silliness from the kids playing in the tree.
when flowers are in bloom, it really brings out people to see them.  <eos> the best part about that is that there are multiple parks and places to see them that enhance the city.  <eos> even the smallest of blooms look beautiful juxtaposed against a city backdrop.  <eos> flowers that take so long to bloom are most enjoyable to people because of the rarity of what they are seeing and take many tours and pictures to remember this moment.  <eos> "even tree will get in on the ""action"" as it were with kids and people climbing on them. this is one of the best parts of being outside and having the flowers in bloom. "
my friends and i went to the arnold arboretum. <eos> we saw a bunch of nice trees and bushes. <eos> some of the bushes were so big. <eos> these were my favorite flowers hanging from the trees. <eos> my friends and i had a great time.
we went to the arnold arboretum for lilac sunday. <eos> there were so many beautiful lilacs, including these lovely white ones. <eos> here is an even better picture of that lovely lilac bush. <eos> the whole event was beautiful, but i tried to get some really pretty shots like this one of the pink. <eos> it was nice to spend time with my family--look at the boys climbing the tree!
we had a family reunion at a botanical garden. <eos> most of the flowers were in full bloom. <eos> i experimented with different focuses. <eos> i am not sure if i like or dislike this one. <eos> the boys ended up liking climbing the trees better than looking at the flowers!
i bought my mother a bouquet when i came home from my freshman year of college.  <eos> i wanted her to know how much she meant to me.  <eos> she was very happy, in her own special quiet way. <eos> she made me a huge batch of dumplings right away. that is how she shows love. <eos> her beef and scallions made me so happy. i love my mother.
the decorations and gifts were worked on tirelessly. <eos> they turned out beautifully! <eos> mother was touched by how thoughtful the gifts were. <eos> they then went out to eat in celebration. <eos> the food was delicious and capped an already lovely day.
this restaurant has amazing flower arrangements. <eos> they even sell them by the bouquet  <eos> they wrap them up neatly. <eos> the dumplings in this place are amazing. <eos> the main courses are cooked to perfection.
what a lovely bouquet. <eos> they were so happy to receive it. <eos> she would surely have it on display. <eos> delicious food was being prepared. <eos> time to dig in.
look at the flowers that i got from my husband. <eos> there he is, about ready to give them to me. <eos> look how happy i am to get them. <eos> cooking some good food. <eos> he deserves a great meal after all he does for me.
i was wandering this building yesterday looking for a way out. i went up the stairs thinking i was below ground. <eos> but i just found myself in a lobby. i went back to see if i missed something. <eos> but then i found myself in a small office closet. <eos> i left the office to find the exit and i checked as many doors as i could find. <eos> eventually i came to a white door at the end of the hallway and it turns out that was the exit.
when the zombie apocalypse hit, everyone disappeared. <eos> it was like no one ever existed. <eos> i couldn't find traces of my friends anywhere. <eos> not even in the hall. <eos> and to make things worse, my mousse melted!
today i started my new job at the mission. <eos> we have activity rooms for people. <eos> there is a lot of paper work to do each day. <eos> we have rooms for those who need them. <eos> it doesn't look like much from the outside.
it's very hard to get an appointment for a spa treatment at the most popular spa in town. even so, the waiting room was quite empty. <eos> i tried different chairs as i waited, including this one in the corner by the window. <eos> the whole two hours i waited for my appointment, i didn't see another soul. <eos> finally, i was called into the hall to go to my treatment room. i was pretty sick of waiting by that point. <eos> however, it was all worthwhile. when i saw that raspberry ripple mousse hair treatment, i knew i was in for a gold star experience. 
this is where i rented my new office space. it's so exciting. doesn't it look fancy? <eos> well inside the rooms it isn't so fancy but it gets the job done! here is the waiting area. <eos> here are my filing cabinets. i really need to get organized. <eos> here's the hallway of the office. i only rented out one room, by the way. <eos> the outside of the building is kind of drab but it's a start and i'm so happy to have my own office space!
there are many families struggling to survive in this environment everyday. <eos> people loot through the garbage that is found on the streets in hopes that they may find something useful or edible. <eos> many of the children have to take care of each other. <eos> some of them are very sad because of the conditions. <eos> everyday they have to struggle to survive just to make it to the next one.
this place is a dump. <eos> i mean it, a real dump. <eos> even the goat was not pleased. <eos> who would live like this? <eos> humanity doesn't have a chance!
the newsman showed how bad the garbage has gotten at the bottom of the village. <eos> the garbage is all the way down to the ditch in front of the buildings. <eos> animals will find their way to the garbage to eat it. <eos> it is beginning to blend in with the water. <eos> it makes a sad and gross picture as the hotel is the backdrop.
i went to hati to help rebuild after the earthquake. <eos> i didn't realize how bad of shape it was until i got there. <eos> i met a nice family while working with the locals. <eos> ru and jon, the families youngest were so sweet. <eos> and the father james helped me rebuild the homes.
third world countries need a lot of help. things like this is the reason why health isn't good. <eos> here is what used to be an old shed turned into a trash bin. <eos> maybe we can get all the goats to clean up the trash! <eos> that is why we are here to help make this a better place. <eos> things like this is what gives me purpose.
i went to visit the cemetery yesterday to pay my respects. <eos> i planted the flag in one of the graves of the soldiers that gave their lives for the freedom of this country. <eos> night started to fall. <eos> at night the statues at the cemetery become slightly creepy. <eos> i decided to leave before it got darker.
visiting the graves of fallen american war heroes, was humbling. <eos> each grave was one life, but represented so much more.  <eos> the history untold, yet forever held in quiet memories of the past. <eos> every stone and flag represented bravery and hearts of pride for this country. <eos> each fallen soldier is a part of the united states, forever more.
this is a memorial to our fallen soldiers. <eos> my brother joseph is buried here. today was the anniversary of his funeral. <eos> jospeh had a friend named david. david was buried here also. this is very sad. <eos> jospeh and david worked with a dog named blackie. blackie was buried along side them. <eos> george washington overlooks this cemetery. he was also buried here.
i went on a somber trip to the cemetery to see some deceased family.  <eos> i placed a flag on one of our past relatives that was a veteran. <eos> there were some extravagant memorials. <eos> this one included a statue of the deceased. <eos> i found this monument very interesting as well.
we visited a very special cemetery today. <eos> there were many old headstones. <eos> there were some very unique headstones. <eos> there were a lot of service members buried there. <eos> there were some headstones with statues on them.
i arrived at the docks early sunday morning and everything was closed up. <eos> i was able to locate my friend's cute town house pretty quickly. <eos> after breakfast we went for a long walk in the historic district. <eos> the architectural details on these historic homes are fantastic. <eos> later that day we went to an old mansion that had been converted into an art museum.
after walking down the pier for hours we decided to take a walk through downtown. <eos> we stopped here to have a bite to eat. <eos> there were many large billboard signs that we saw throughout downtown. <eos> some of the apartment buildings downtown are very tall. <eos> this building had so many plants on the property.
this place has the most beautiful scenery.  <eos> there are great places to stop and eat. <eos> they have billboards like i had never seen before. <eos> the buildings are as tall as i can see. <eos> i loved it so much, i decided to buy a place of my own!
we arrived to the city by canal boat, and docked at the port. <eos> it was a nice city to walk though, with unique architecture. <eos> our hotel was up a long pathway from the port, there were a lot of stairs. <eos> many of the buildings in the city had decks and porches, because the weather was so nice. <eos> we finally arrived at our hotel, it was a beautiful building surrounded with lush landscaping.
the first thing we did on our vacation was check out the boardwalk. <eos> there was all sorts of things to do but we quickly grabbed a bite to eat. <eos> heading into town we started getting thirsty. <eos> some of the buildings were so tall you really had strain your neck to see the top. <eos> after a long walkabout we were excited to see the front door and get ready for tomarrow.
yesterday i went to church. <eos> the inside of the church is very clean. <eos> there was no one there yet when i showed up because i was early. <eos> the stained glass windows are very beautiful in the church. <eos> they want to be sure that you are quiet during mass.
today we looked at the new apartment. i was glad to see how clean and nice it was. though the bedrooms and other areas of the unit were nice, we couldn't believe how nice the kitchen was. <eos> the photo's on from the ad didn't do it justice. the bathroom was immaculate and exceptionally clean <eos> the stove was of commercial quality. it had over 6 burners and the realtor told me it was a vulcan unit.  <eos> the kitchen had a lot of counter space and a peninsula that came way out into the main area where we will be doing the cooking.  <eos> overall, me and my wife were very pleased with the apartment, especially this kitchen. i can't get over how they are made such a large kitchen for a 2 bedroom apartment. we will probably be renting it.
this is the saturday befor my wedding. <eos> we're going to have the reception in this room. a dj will be by the door over there. <eos> the dance floor will be in the back corner. with about 20 tables of people here. <eos> this is the chapel. i've loved this stain glass window every since i was a child. <eos> this silence sign is used because our church likes to meditate as well as preach. this room is used to meditate, so it helps remind everyone to be quiet.
during the visit, we went by the cathedral for a tour.  <eos> the cathedral was very large and empty with an old style feel.  <eos> big open rooms, and arches filled the cathedral.  <eos> there were large stained glass windows; one of which featured a beautiful rendering of jesus.  <eos> the word 'silence' found on the wall replicated the silence found in the large and empty building. 
i went to visit a church in the town i was visiting. <eos> it is quite simple inside, much more plain than i would expect it to be. <eos> the columns are quite nice but nothing out of the ordinary. <eos> this picture is one of the only artwork available. <eos> "this made me giggle. then i quickly looked around, hoping i had not made too much noise. i could just imagine a none telling me, ""silence"""
we went to stay at an old log home last weekend. <eos> there were many giant windmills surrounding the home. <eos> at night they would spin silently. <eos> when it really blew hard the noise they made was deafening. <eos> we had beautiful sunsets out there.
today started out as a very nice day on our coast to coast bicycle tour. it started our fairly sunny, but mother nature had other things in store for us. <eos> we wanted to accomplish at least 100 miles and breeze through north dakota, however when the winds changed, we were stuck. <eos> we started out with a tail wind and were averaging 18-20 miles per hour on our bicycles, but that all changed at around 11am. <eos> we now had a tail wind and were only making an average speed of 6 miles per hour. it was like riding through quick sand. <eos> to make matters worse, the cloud cover kept thickening up and ultimately we were stuck in a bad hail storm so we had to make camp in a field and compete our day with only 50 miles under our belts. 
so much beauty can be found when you know where to look.  <eos> the great open fields filled with rows of windmills took my breath at dusk.  <eos> with the sun shining through the clouds behind the windmills, i felt i could watch forever.  <eos> they towered high into the sky.  <eos> so high they seemed to enjoy the company of the clouds. 
the family took a trip to the countryside. <eos> the sunsets were always beautiful out there. <eos> even the windmills look great in such a scenic area. <eos> there really were a lot of windmills out there. <eos> it made us happy to see all that clean energy.
this house has seen it all weather wise. now it's such a beautiful sight to see. <eos> the windmills were engulfed within the clouds before i took this one. <eos> as the sun set it's like peace and relaxation sitting here. <eos> the windmills were as tall as skyscrapers and they generate so much power! <eos> during the car ride home i had to take one last photo. it was a good one.
bob bought an abandoned storage lot at an auction. <eos> it had an old record player in it that hadn't been used for years. <eos> bob worked hard getting the stuff out of the small room. <eos> the person that had owned the room must have taken calculus (ugh) and save their note book. <eos> when he was done cleaning out the room, went went to get something to eat.
yesterday at panera i was having a late dinner. <eos> i ordered a sandwich and some soup. <eos> afterward i had to go to my public storage garage for something and there was all this stuff outside one of the garages. <eos> the inside of my public storage unit is pretty messy. <eos> thankfully i found the table i was looking for.
i started the night with a trip to panera. <eos> i ordered a delicious lettuce sandwich and a bowl of beans. <eos> then i made a trip to the storage facility, where i was greeted by cutouts of roger rabbit and bob hoskins. <eos> i had to dig through a lot of my belongings to get what i was really after. <eos> finally, i found it: a plain wooden table.
before going to my storage locker i stopped off for some food. <eos> this place always serves up great sandwiches. <eos> after eating i made it the storage unit. <eos> it is so full of papers and other things that i do not need. <eos> i found this old desk in there that i forgot i had.
we won a bid on the locker during a storage auction. <eos> we were disappointed that the record player was not complete. <eos> we were excited to see who framed roger rabbit movie memorabilia. <eos> we found some school notebooks that we had to throw away. <eos> we celebrated the locker finds by going out for lunch.
we took a walk through a historic park. <eos> this sign was interesting. i wonder what people would be digging for? <eos> so serene here though. <eos> fort wilkinson, georgia. this plaque explains some history. <eos> this stone was etched with this beautiful phrase.
signs are wonderfully informative things. <eos> many times, they are brief and to the point, a warning meant to be heeded. <eos> other times, they mark an important location and moment in time. <eos> as human beings, we want to mark the passage of time and history with signs. <eos> we don't want to forget.
when i finally got to the historic site there was no one else there. <eos> there was no digging allowed according to the sign. <eos> it was a beautiful place. <eos> there were a lot of information plaques. <eos> i read them all.
we visited some historic sites on our trip. <eos> they had a lot of warning signs when we arrived. <eos> after that we traveled the paths at the site. <eos> then we came across signs that told us the history of the site. <eos> after that we came across some old graves at the site.
a sign pointed to a local historic site. <eos> i made sure not to dig up anything with the shovel i brought. <eos> nature was sprawling and tall trees were everywhere. <eos> a slab was dedicated to telling us about the park. <eos> a stone had writing carved into it that we couldn't read because we walked by it too fast. 
the bike ride brought several enthusiasts together. <eos> who traveled in interesting manners. <eos> and dressed in interesting clothing. <eos> the event was a big hit. <eos> afterwards, they got together for food and drink.
every summer there is this awesome party thrown in the neighborhood. <eos> super soakers welcome! <eos> but mainly everyone invents a bicycle that has a trailer on it. <eos> and the trailer is full of random items. <eos> it is so much fun watching the cyclists ride their creations.
i decided to take a bicycle ride through the city yesterday. <eos> there were a lot of other people riding their bikes as well. <eos> there were also some interesting outfits. <eos> some cars had trouble getting through all of the cyclists. <eos> afterward we were all very tired from biking everywhere.
richie finally got the chance to show off his bikini top. <eos> alexander was about to squirt the bikini off of richie's torso. <eos> a bicycle carried another bicycle. <eos> one man had a bike that let him sit down. <eos> "a car ended up getting confused and attending a ""bike only"" area. "
starting the day off with a little gender experimentation. <eos> getting all ready for the bike parade. <eos> the bike parade is going very nicely. <eos> al has one dope-ass ride. <eos> """get your damn toys off the street you stupid libs!"""
on a lonesome, winding mountain road, while riding our bikes, we were abducted.  <eos> down tight, filthy corridors we were drug, our terror growing the deeper we were brought.  <eos> we were left in a stone walled room with only a metal ladder for an exit; there we were subjected to unrepeatable acts of torture and depravity.  <eos> months later, what was left of us was taken through a dirt tunnel...  <eos>  ... and tossed into the putrid pea green lake, which our restless spirits to this day haunt. 
i went on vacation last year. <eos> the place was right by the water. <eos> it was very beautiful. <eos> there were many rocks around. <eos> i took a few boat rides out on the ocean.
living in the mountains of utah has been one of the best decisions i ever made. <eos> here you have access to biking trails and hiking trails with the most awesome views ever. <eos> there are a surprising number of lakes and reservoirs where you can sail or motor boat or try any water sport you like. <eos> i like rock climbing along the north face. <eos> lake powell is my favorite with the great salt lake as the runner up.
it's a long hike to the hidden lagoon. <eos> the housing is very basic, in underground dugouts. <eos> we sleep in the cool, long tunnels. <eos> they all have drains to the outside. <eos> but it's all worth it when we get to bathe in the green-blue warm water.
brothers bike riding in the mountain. <eos> exploring an abandon house.  <eos> and discovering a hidden chamber.  <eos> secret passage way to the beach. <eos> beautiful view of the beach at the end of the tunnel. 
this building is now over 200 years old. <eos> the men were on a break and talking about the war.  <eos> the trees in the front yard were large. <eos> back in the day there were a lot more trees in the neighborhood.  <eos> this house is still standing and looking great today.
historic papers had a history to tell. <eos> details of life a century ago was in fine print. <eos> there were images to accompany the print. <eos> there was much green space then as well. <eos> many were homes owned by early settlers.
i love looking at my great grandparents pictures that they took.  <eos> grandma said that this picture was taken just before the war. <eos> and this was part of the city park that they used to picnic at. <eos> here is a picture of their house. it is not even there anymore and hasn't been for over 30 years. <eos> here is the mayor's house, you can tell that they came from a rich background.
before the battle me and all of the other leadership met up. <eos> we had long talks about what was expected. <eos> where to deploy the cannons, and where they should point. <eos> we had an idea to place them in the trees to make the 1st few shots a surprise. <eos> some of them where even hidden behind houses.
today the class was looking at history  <eos> we saw a lot of old looking pictures. <eos> some of the pictures were of familiar places where we lived. <eos> however a lot of these places were of old parks that had been torn down. <eos> history sure is interesting. there's a lot to learn!
it was a great day for a cook out. <eos> the family were enjoying themselves. <eos> uncle bob provide the entertainment. <eos> we fired up the grill <eos> and had some cold beer.
i went for a walk downtown earlier. <eos> i saw a motorcycle with three wheels. <eos> some of the garbage cans were broken.  <eos> the church had beautiful stained glass windows. <eos> afterward i finally arrived back at my apartment.
my photo-taking journey around the city started with this lovely scaffolding under a deep blue sky. <eos> this lovely gentleman on this tri-ped breezed past me. <eos> the beautiful trashcan gave me inspriation as contrasta gainst the grey street stripes. <eos> the stained glass i saw later on reminded me of old englande. <eos> and near the end, this chimney swept my heart away in atmospheric ruminations.
a bright blue sky to start off the day. <eos> taking the trike on a drive across town. <eos> passed an odd shaped trash can that could have seen better days. <eos> saw a beautiful glass sign that was perfect for the old lady but the owner refused to sell. <eos> above a crow watches from the chimney.
raymond loved his house. and as much as he enjoyed his, but he loved being with his girlfriend carla. and he enjoyed his girlfriend carla's even more than his own. he even put the good luck reef on his front door that she had given him.  <eos> along the way to his girlfriend carla's house raymond passes his old job at the construction site down the street from him. <eos> raymond usually drives his car to carla's but today he only had enough gas in his car to get back and forth to work until payday, so he road his dirt bike through the streets to get to her. <eos> raymond even stopped at the seaport he passed along the way to catch a little fish. he knew it was carla's favorite. <eos> finally, he arrives and notices carla hasn't gotten home from work yet. he looks at his watch and smiles. only five minutes left.
this was an old photo of the courthouse int eh 1950s. <eos> the were delivering some very important artwork.  <eos> they were getting the lighting ready to be hung also. <eos>  the building looks exactly the same today. <eos> this is a shot from across the street.
they visited the tourist attraction on an overcast day. <eos> inside they found a museum. <eos> they took their time to appreciate the art. <eos> there were paintings and sculptures. <eos> there was even a beautiful drawing of the building itself.
the history class was looking at old pictures <eos> to try and piece history together. <eos> they looked at old museums, <eos> and they looked at old artwork. <eos> but what they were most interested in was the old buildings. they loved seeing how history has changed them. 
the old building looked very important. <eos> on the inside was a few art exhibits. <eos> they were painted with extreme precision. <eos> a wing of the museum had amazing sculptures. <eos> a painting of a giant building inspired me to want to paint. 
the tall columns on the building had been made of imported stone.  <eos> the trucks delivered heavy sculptures.  <eos> one sculpture was so large it had to be moved with a crane.  <eos> many years ago, the road was lined with c chain fence.  <eos> you can see an old model t parked on the wide road that was new at the time. 
today was the day of the polar plunge for charity! <eos> the water was so cold it had ice in parts of it. <eos> tons of people came out to take the plunge. <eos> everyone's ready to run into the water. <eos> the water was so freezing!
arriving at the lake festivities.  <eos> the cold weather didn't stop the boys from getting in their swimsuits.  <eos> we all took a dip in the freezing cold this is going to be a yearly thing.  <eos> the rowing races were fun to watch and off to a great start.  <eos> you can clearly see the winner won by a landslide and now everyone has their shirt off. 
people gather together in the cold to go for a swim. <eos> the water still has sheets of ice in it. <eos> some people are there just to watch and take pictures. <eos> it`s a big event that happens every year. <eos> that water is completely freezing, those are some brave people.
people were getting ready for the new year's day arctic plunge. <eos> look how cold that water is. those people are brave. <eos> there was a large crowd of participants and spectators. <eos> here they are waiting for the whistle to dive in. <eos> in they went to the cold water.
john, steve and mary had signed up to do the polar plunge for charity.  <eos> there were many people there that day that had signed up.  <eos> after the first few people jumped in, it went fast.  <eos> there were as many onlookers as people participating.  <eos> there were also many people that were scared to jump in.
today we had the biggest snow storm of the winter! <eos> we were snowed in and couldn't leave. <eos> plenty of other cars got stuck on the side of the road in the storm. <eos> the kids loved playing in the snow building a snowman. <eos> finally the roads were cleared we were able to get out!
this is camille's house. when she awoke this morning she had a wonderful discovery. it had snowed! <eos> the neighborhood was covered with two feet of snow.  <eos> a few cars managed to make a trail through the snow.  <eos> the main road was much better. still a good idea to drive carefully.  <eos> camille built a snowman taller than herself.
this place is having their winter season. <eos> the car near the house was covered with snow. <eos> even the roads, the cars on the roads, the trees were also covered with snow. <eos> the two kids were enjoying the snow and making snowman. <eos> the place was surrounded with snow no people around because it was cold outside.
the house is covered in snow. <eos> the street is covered in snow. <eos> this is a winter scene. <eos> the street needs to be plowed. <eos> some children are playing in the snow.
we woke up to find our entire neighborhood covered in snow. <eos> i never look forward to cleaning the snow off of the car. <eos> most of the roads were closed, so i decided that it would be more fun to spend the day enjoying the snow with the kids rather than clean the snow off of the car. <eos> the kids had so much fun building a snowman that my five year old ended up with snow in her hood. big sister is helping to clear the snow out. by the look on her face, i think she might have put it there in the first place! <eos> by evening the roads were fairly clear. that means it's back to work tomorrow.
it's sleep over night and the boys are going to have some fun. <eos> first, an indoor water gun fight. <eos> ok, maybe it's time to take things down a step and watch a movie. <eos> dancing mummies? zombies? who cares, as long as it's fun! <eos> "nothing beats an old fashioned ""horsey"" ride!"
i invited all my friends over to my house today so that we could play together. <eos> we had a great time.  <eos> we played lots of games together. <eos> after a while we got tired. <eos> we sat on the floor and watched movies together.
the boys posed cool for the picture. <eos> the boys enjoyed playing a game of cops and robbers in the house. <eos> the boys watched their favorite movie on the television. <eos> the boys made funny clothes out of plastic bags.  <eos> the boys pretended they were at a wrestling match. 
when all the cousins get together, it's a wild time. <eos> of course there are nerf fights and video game challenges. <eos> there are long slumber party times, with some wild stories and tv watching. <eos> there's dressing up crazily for a show. <eos> and there's dancing around---lots of dancing around!
two boys pose for the camera like cool dudes. <eos> they are having a sleepover and are very excited. <eos> they camp out in the living room in front of the tv. <eos> they dress up with bags making them into clothing items. <eos> finally dad decides to give them piggy back rides.
i had a great time at the party last week. <eos> they invited a team of cheerleaders to perform. <eos> many awards were given out. <eos> a lot of people were interviewed. <eos> afterward i left the ceremony to find some food.
one of the university's football players won a prestigious award,  <eos> so the school decided to hold a banquet to benefit his accomplishments. <eos> the school band performed, <eos> as did the cheerleaders. <eos> even the head of the alumni association made a speech about how proud alumni were of their school's continual excellence. the benefit was extremely successful and the football player felt really good about all the glory that he had brought to his alma mater. 
every was gathering before the big game. <eos> the cheerleaders were ready for it to start. <eos> players were acknowledged with special gifts. <eos> the interviews were almost over. <eos> the game would start soon!
the awards banquet was in full effect and the venue was packed full of people. <eos> cheerleaders performed their routine. <eos> the star player accepted his award and the reporter asked to comment on what this recognition meant to him.  <eos> the report asked his team members to say a few words as well. <eos> outside of the venue, the streets were packed with people waiting to see the athletes.
maclain accepts the trophy from the ncaa committee. <eos> they host a party just in his favor. <eos> they even bring in the marching band. <eos> the cheerleaders from his school even make the trip. <eos> dr rivers congratulates maclain on being awesome.
a big surprise for times square. <eos> the army is putting in a unique career center. <eos> looking good so far. i'd like to see the inside. <eos> a few more sheets and it will be open for business. <eos> this is really cool looking. would be cool to work in this one.
the workers pulled the metal panel out of the truck.  <eos> they carried the panel a little ways down the street.  <eos> they had very little time to get it all put together. they had to work quickly and efficiently. <eos> using an electric drill the screws went right out.  <eos> it was all ready. everyone could look at this ad now. 
many people visit times square because of the bright lights. <eos> there is a large police presence to watch over the many people. <eos> construction workers set up an army recruiting building. <eos> two workers move a metal plate from their truck. <eos> a new screen is installed in the front of the building.
we visited times square in new york city. <eos> first we came to an advertisement of the army. <eos> then we saw on advertisement on an led screen. <eos> we watched as the construction workers complete their project. <eos> after that we came to the u.s. armed forced career center.
the city is very crowded with people. <eos> the cops watch over to keep it safe. <eos> we are getting ready to set up the party. <eos> we are carrying the table. <eos> ken is adjusting everything just right.
i ran into an oscar grant protest while in the city. <eos> everybody had protest signs. <eos> many ethnicity were represented. <eos> there were even some hispanics there. <eos> people were leaving graffiti everywhere.
the protest was for oscar grant who had been gunned down by the police.  <eos> people made banners with his picture.  <eos> they demanded justice.  <eos> everyone blamed the police.  <eos> the rogue cops had given them all a bad name. 
a large crowd of people rallied in protest of the murder of oscar grant. <eos> two individuals held a sign with his picture on it. <eos> other crowd members made their own signs to hold in the demonstration. <eos> a couple of women held posters demanding justice for oscar grant. <eos> someone even made sidewalk art asking for justice.
"a sign laid near the street with the words ""oscar grant,"" on it.  <eos> people held signs showing there support for oscar grant. <eos> the crowd wanted justice for oscar. <eos> protesters held signs against injustice.  <eos> ""two guys held a sign that read, "" to serve & protect whom."""
this is the story of oscar grant, who was killed by police though he was unarmed. <eos> he became a symbol for average people who feel oppressed in their communities. <eos> all kinds of people come out to voice their anger.  <eos> these are posters that appear in many cities in our country.  <eos> that's spanish for justice for oscar. 
today was the day. <eos> we were going to finally do. <eos> we built a bridge. <eos> and it actually worked. <eos> now about the rest of the roast....
we drove to a lake to go fishing. <eos> we got on our boat after some time. <eos> when we left we had to make a bridge to cross the water. <eos> our car was able to make it across. <eos> the children missed us a lot.
this year when we went to our summer home there was work that was needed to be done. <eos>  we carried the wood across two boats. <eos> some of that wood was needed to build a make sift bridge. <eos> we where really happy that it worked. losing the car in the water would not have been something we would have wanted for sure. <eos> even the kids helped. it was a good summer for us all.
we embarked on a mission trip to south america.  <eos> we weren't sure what we'd be doing, but we knew there would be hard work ahead when we saw a barge approaching with lumber. <eos> as it turned out, a bridge had collapsed, so we got right to work.  <eos> a quick drive-over test proved our work worthwhile! <eos> by the end of the day, the local kids were exhausted and took a break.
what do you do when you have to cross a body of water with your car but don't have a ferry available? <eos> build one, of course! <eos> a new bridge is also necessary, but we had that covered as well. <eos> luckily, it worked. was sort of afraid of what would happen to the car, but it went well. <eos> all to get from one dirt path to another. just another day in a remote area.
our family got together for a feast a few nights ago. <eos> the kids had a lot of cool things to look at. <eos> the meal took a long time to prepare. <eos> as you can see, it worked out very nicely and we all ate a lot. <eos> we took one last picture with my sisters and brothers before we left.
we had a great get together  <eos> there was so much food <eos> my mom went all out on the cooking <eos> there was so much bacon <eos> and a wholec crockpot of beans
we all got together for our family sunday dinner. <eos> the children were fascinated with the little lizard. <eos> the cooking was a chore but everyone chipped in and helped. <eos> the fruits of our labor on display, it was so delicious. <eos> everyone had a fine time as we usually do for our family dinner.
we had a great meal today. <eos> we had all kinds of goodies. <eos> we had homemade spaghetti sauce. <eos> we also had great fried potato skins. <eos> but the very best was the homemade chili. it was a real feast.
the three sisters gathered to celebrate thanksgiving. <eos> their mom made a lot of good food for dinner.  <eos> she even made tons of mashed potatoes and spaghetti sauce.  <eos> the plate of pulled pork is always a crowd pleaser.  <eos> black eyed peas are delicious as well. 
the kids set up a huge water slide on the hill. <eos> they looked down it in anticipation. <eos> everyone had a look of determination as they prepared to slide. <eos> the sister braved the slide first. <eos> they the smallest brother slid down.
emily was the first to own the water slide of our four children. <eos> calab was next and despite our warnings he went in head first.  <eos> he quickly turned himself around toward the end though to right himself.  <eos> then he joined his sister for a joint ride down the slide, both pacing themselves so they did not run into one another. <eos> meeting up at the top once more with her other brother and sister. 
my family set up a slip and slide this weekend. <eos> all the kids were really excited to go down. <eos> my daughter was the first one to try. <eos> she looks like shes having a great time! <eos> my son was even brave enough to go down head first!
today we made a water slide outside of our house. <eos> the kids ran the hose over to the slide so it could get wet. <eos> our daughter decided to slide down first. although she was a bit nervous. <eos> then she got over it quickly as she slid down. <eos> after that our son slid belly first like a penguin and had a blast.
summer fun! slip and slide. <eos> here goes my brother. <eos> how'd he get up like that? <eos> oh, he taught me how to do it. <eos> let's all go down together.
we put on quite a luncheon at the office. <eos> there was a lot of meats and veggies. <eos> everyone cleaned their plates though. <eos> we were pretty sparse with the decor. <eos> the decor was simple, but it worked out fine.
when tom said that he was doing his house japanese style for the party, i didn't really believe him.  <eos> but when we got there, i was stunned at what he had pulled off.  <eos> even the dining table was low and we had to sit on the floor to eat.  <eos> and the serving platters and dishes were all authentic.  <eos> he even had original japanese artwork on the walls. he went all out. 
this weekend we planned an amazing dinner for the family. <eos> we decided that we would have traditional japanese food. <eos> the table display was so amazing. <eos> everyone enjoyed the food for much. <eos> i was very proud of the get together and i hope to plan many more. 
the catering was well done.  <eos> they were many different dishes for all of our tastes.  <eos> we were able to try many types of flavors.  <eos> the day went really well at the office party.  <eos> good music and food brought every one closer together.
from the entrance, the decorations told us we were having a traditional japanese meal. <eos> the low tables had all sorts of delicious food our hosts had prepared. <eos> but that was just the beginning, we saw as we walked towards a larger table with a fest spread upon it. <eos> soon we'd consumed everything -- it was all so tasty, and interesting, too. <eos> we took a moment before we left to take a closer look at the art on the walls, and found the meaning for our hosts; i guess it's rude to ask to come back right away!
fixing up his bike. <eos> following the pacific coast bike route. <eos> taking a lunch break. <eos> eating fruits and sandwiches <eos> about to cross the san francisco bridge.
i went down to the beach last week. <eos> it was a lot of fun there. <eos> the waves were slamming against the rocks. <eos> we sat in the shade when it was too hot. <eos> we had to bike back home afterward.
this weekend we geared up and got our bikes out for a little adventure. <eos> we made sure to use the bike routes.  <eos> it was a blast. we traveled for miles and miles. <eos> this was jan's first time riding a bike in a long time. <eos> we just had to get a picture of the golden gate bridge in the background. it was a fabulous time. 
preparing the bike for the trip. <eos> setting out on the highway 1 trail. <eos> eating up the miles on new terrain. <eos> time for a rest stop. <eos> posing next to a beautiful view
the man got his bike ready for his trip. <eos> he was planning to ride up the pacific coast highway. <eos> he was joined by two friends, who were just as excited. <eos> it was a tough ride, so they rewarded themselves with a picnic lunch. <eos> their arrival at the golden gate bridge marked a milestone in their trip.
hank and janet's new years eve party in 1999 was a blast.  <eos> we were waiting for 2000 and wondering if y2k would hit.  <eos> but everyone was having such a good time, they forgot about the doom and gloom.  <eos> janet and carol had a good time.  <eos> and so did wanda and jen. though i think jen was wasted by midnight. 
i went to shelly's party last night and it was a mess. <eos> everyone was wearing the weirdest clothing. <eos> so many people were drunk. <eos> i took a picture will shelly and left. <eos> i went home and had a relaxing time with my sister.
billy and i had our picture taken before we went to the party. <eos> emily was already wearing silly party glasses when we arrived. <eos> everyone was dancing and having a great time. <eos> susan refused to put on her party crown. <eos> amber and amy posed with their crowns when the clock struck midnight.
a couple of the guest arrived and posed they have very stylish hats. <eos> inside the house, the celebration begins. the food and drinks can be seen. <eos> the party ramps up. everyone is having a good time. <eos> the host wearing the green hat poses for a photo with her friend. <eos> the host now poses with a different friend.
the year 2000 was on its way, so a group of friends decided to welcome it with a party. <eos> they filled their cups with beer and put on some new year gear. <eos> excitement built as midnight approached and the friends talked and danced. <eos> at 11:59 pm it was time to gather around and count down to the new year together. <eos> after midnight, everybody felt tired and giddy. the year 2000 was off to a good start!
i went down to the beach last week. <eos> the sun was setting so we decided to head to head to the hotel instead. <eos> it was a long drive. <eos> when we finally arrived it took forever to find a parking space. <eos> we had a good night's rest.
the sun was coming up. <eos> me & jordy were waiting in the car. <eos> bill arrived and parked close to us. <eos> here's me & bill! <eos> the view from the top of the mountain. 
they had started the car trip so early they kept joey in his pajamas. <eos> after driving for two hours the sun began to rise. <eos> they had just gotten to the top of the mountain when the sun filled the valley below them. <eos> they ate breakfast at a road side park that had a display about local flowers. <eos> after breakfast they got back into the car to start driving again.
someone was a little grumpy on the road trip. <eos> the sun made for a wonderful view. <eos> we came across some beautiful sights. <eos> there were boards to help identify things. <eos> our car after we finally settled in for the night.
my family and i arrived on top of the mountain at sunset. <eos> we took pictures inside the suv.  <eos> we parked on the top of the mountain. <eos> we took pictures on top of the mountain. <eos> we looked over the mountain. 
the scenery is pure beauty right before we get to the dome in rome.  <eos> the walk before we got to the cathedral.  <eos> here is the what is left of the cathedral in rome.  <eos> here we are inside the cathedral and loving every minute of it.  <eos> here is some of the art we seen while there at the cathedral. 
i finally had the opportunity to visit an ancient civilization during summer break. <eos> along with viewing many old monuments, several art exhibits were up for display, <eos> including some that were religious. <eos> after the exploration, i decided to roam around the city with my friends to look for a bar. <eos> we had a toast to a great day.
we were so excited to visit the basiclia! <eos> when we arrived, i had to get several pictures, including the nameplate.. <eos> and, the amazing mural. <eos> we were tired when left; however, i wasn't ready to go home yet. <eos> so, we decided to grab a nice cold ale and enjoy the moonlight.
this is the beginning of a perfect vacation. <eos> i wanted to go to a place that would give me a sense of history. <eos> i am a place that puts me in awe of the architecture of the past. <eos> what a great feeling to be part of an important time in history. <eos> this is a beautiful scene to celebrate how the past affects the present. 
the morning view in greece. hopefully it warms up. <eos> went down to the main area of town to meet our guide and group. <eos> the colosium. i have always wanted to see this and now i am! <eos> we are actually inside of it! this is so amazing and a big part of history. <eos> statues left in the colosium. very surreal and inspiring.
my family came together for a christmas dinner.sitting around talking. <eos> my kids snacking and enjoying the company of their family. <eos> my cousins and their husbands standing around enjoying wine. <eos> kids were wondering where the presants were.come on dad open just one? <eos> my sister and my niece sitting on the couch.the little ones are very tired.
everyone was gathered at my best friend's house, awaiting the countdown of the new year. <eos> the adults weren't the only ones excited, and waiting. <eos> although some needed to be fed, and take a nap. <eos> many gathered in the kitchen, anxiously waiting. <eos> until it was announced on the tv that it was now a new year!
a group of friends and family gather for a christmas party. <eos> two of the children sneak and eat some cheese balls. <eos> one couple sits down to feed their twins. <eos> the group gathers in the kitchen to talk and enjoy refreshments. <eos> they all sit down to watch the christmas parade on the television.
this is my family of thugs.  <eos> today we are having a party to teach the young ones in the family our traditions <eos> when they grow up the kids will take over the family business of selling seagull tears. <eos> the family likes to keep all the business inside house.  <eos> we will like to one see a report about our family business in the news. that would be awesome.
we got together with all our college friends last week. it was amazing to see that we all had kids now. <eos> my own becky and joe were joined by lots of other little ones. <eos> we tried to act college cool, but it's harder with a million kids in tow! <eos> some of the parents were anti-tv, but i figured it was my house and i'd put the tv on if i wanted to. <eos> i loved seeing all the little ones show their parents that they weren't as cool as they thought!
new years eve 2011. we watched the last day of 2010 end.  <eos> beautiful sky as it got dark.  <eos> people looked up and waited for midnight! <eos> beautiful lights in the neighborhood.  <eos> we looked up as the time hit midnight. it was 2011!
the train arrived in the station at 9:45.  <eos> the group walked to their favorite spot on the dock and waited until dark.  <eos> once it was dark they did their yearly walk to the tower.  <eos> after the tower they walked to the dock as they have done many years before.  <eos> they waited for the sun to rise to end their wonderful night. 
six friends are at a bridge with the sunset in the distance. <eos> the sunset in the sky shows colors of orange, yellow and blue. <eos> there was a festival in the night with little tents and small lit lanterns. <eos> each one of the trees were decorated with colorful fluorescent lights. <eos> ended the night looking at the red tower for the year of 2011.
i gathered with my friends on the rooftop to get a good view of the festivities.  <eos> the sky was clear and beautiful.  <eos> we could see all of the vendors and people on the street.  <eos> there was quite a crowd gathering.  <eos> almost midnight and time for the new year to begin. 
what a beautiful sunset. <eos> now that the sun has set it is time to have some fun. <eos> let's go and enjoy each other's company. <eos> new we just have to wait in the dark <eos> the celebration was well worth the wait. 
our vacation led us on an unusual trail. <eos> the nature all around us amazed us. <eos> the sky promised good weather ahead. <eos> the kids were particularly happy about this vacation choice. <eos> we were really happy we had decided to come. 
the kids were excited for their beach trip, <eos> even though it was winter and they had to wear lots of layers and couldn't go in the cold water. <eos> they still had fun, though. they wrote their names and the date in the sand, and who knows, maybe the waves will spare them and the memory of them being there will live on forever. <eos> they also had a great time jumping off the cliffs, <eos> and watching the waves roll in from the ocean. even though they couldn't swim, they still had an awesome beach trip. 
my best friend and i having a good time out doors with the crisps cool air.  <eos> i am posing for a picture for my best friend to add to album.  <eos> i decided to draw in the sand the date and location where we were on vacation.  <eos> decided to jump from a small cliff just to have a good time and be spontaneous.  <eos> looking at the water coming in on beach from up here is beautiful. 
the boardwalk to the beach is well built and beautifully surrounded by grass. <eos> the grass is tall and gives the ocean a wonderful look. <eos> the sky is clear with wispy white clouds. <eos> a brother and sister pose for a picture together. <eos> this trip to plum island in 2012 will always be remembered. 
the journey to the island's beach was long, but for us that was part of the fun. <eos> tall grass turned brown from the fall weather stretched out on either side of the path we followed. <eos> the sky above was a beautiful blue against a light dusting of clouds. <eos> i treasure the memories i have walking that path with my older sister. <eos> i guess i really treasure all my memories from that beach.
i saw a squirrel in the tree in my back yard. <eos> it amazes me how they can cling to the trees. <eos> he came down out of the tree and stopped. <eos> i began to move slowly towards him. <eos> he didn't seem to mind that i was getting close to him.
the coach giving a great before game pep talk. <eos> patrick threw the ball, they are fumbling for it. <eos> john trying to make an air play. <eos> poor steve they are ganging up on him. <eos> run jack run and he makes it.
the team huddled to prepare for the game.  <eos> the game was very important to them.  <eos> they played with intensity.  <eos> the other team gave them a major challenge.  <eos> all the players did their best. 
my husband is a huge sports fan. he's always watching some sport on tv i don't even know the name of. <eos> i can't get what this sport is! it kind of looks like a cross between soccer and football. <eos> i know in soccer, you can't hold the ball, so it's probably not soccer. <eos> the ball looks like a football, but the players don't have any helmets on. <eos> my husband watches like it's the super bowl, and i just roll my eyes.
several fell over during the game <eos> so they regrouped. <eos> the guy hit the ball up <eos> and couldn't believe it. <eos> they ran after the ball so they could win the game.
we finally arrived in the city after driving for hours. <eos> there were still some people out at this time of night. <eos> some of the streets were empty though. <eos> there were some shady looking individuals. <eos> we decided it would be best to stick together if we walk around.
the mother and daughter were on vacation and admiring old buildings. <eos> there were some beautiful ones with columns. <eos> the buildings were very old and tall. <eos> they visited a market next. <eos> they ended the night heading out to get some dinner.
we went to the city pretty late at night. <eos> we were surprised at the energy and activity. <eos> there were still a few empty streets we came across. <eos> we were never very far from some other late night travelers. <eos> at the end of a good walk we decided to cross the street to the bar for a cool drink.
the cab dropped them off for a night on the town. <eos> everyone is in a festive mood. <eos> the evening grows late and the streets are more deserted. <eos> but travel a little further to where the action is... <eos> on the streets everything bursts into color!
they people parked their car next to the curb under the light pole. <eos> they took a walk on the sidewalk and passed others that were walking and standing around. <eos> the moon was shining bright that night. <eos> there were buildings on each side of the street. <eos> the night was coming to an end and every departed.
the couple was taking a tour of the city looking at statues and arts. <eos> they made their way to the open area. <eos> there was a lot of beautiful art in the open area. <eos> there also was a balcony overlooking the courtyard. <eos> they ended their tour looking at a beautiful architecturally sound building.
the tourist decided to go sight seeing today. <eos> it was snowy out side. <eos> snow covered everything. <eos> the tourist managed to take pictures of some statutes. <eos> the tourists favorite view was of the city.
i went for a walk in the snow. which at first glance seemed bleak. <eos> it was pretty cold and i wondered if i had on the correct shoes. <eos>  as i looked around i began to see how beautiful the snow made everything. <eos> the statues looked as if they might walk somewhere to get warm. <eos> the large plaza then filled with other people looking around to see the beauty.
i decide to take a walk on a cold winters day. <eos> i looked down at my feet and thought about where things had gone wrong with my girlfriend. <eos> i wanted to sit down on a bench but it was covered in snow. <eos> i looked up and saw a statue of a couple, standing, frozen. <eos> as i looked out ove the park i decided i was not going to remain stuck. i would call vanessa.
i visited a public park in europe. it had a lot of art on display, such as these statues. <eos> the fountain at the center of the square was not functioning that day. <eos> the designs on the gate were exquisitely done. <eos> the steps next to the building granted a wonderful view of the park. <eos> these light posts were very ornate.
the show in las vegas was absolutely stunning. the show girls put on an excellent performance. <eos> the lead guitarist of that band i like was doing some serious shredding during the set. <eos> the other guitarist was putting on a show for sure. he was tossing his guitar every which way. <eos> the lead singer looked right at us and i could swear he winked at me. <eos> this is from the last song of the night; it was such a wonderful time to listen to that band play.
the bachelor party arrived in los vegas and encountered some dancers. <eos> next they went to the concert.  <eos> it was very loud and exciting. <eos> the performers were great singers and had some awesome guitar solos. <eos> there was a lot of crazy people at the concert including flashers.
my wife and i went on a fun vacation together in las vegas. <eos> we saw a concert with a really great cover band. <eos> the guitarist really did an amazing job. it was like seeing the real band! <eos> the whole band was amazing! <eos> the concert got a little crazy. what happens in vegas stays in vegas!
a concert was held in las vegas. dancers stood outside. <eos> the guitarist played a solo. <eos> the bassist pointed his instrument at the crowd. <eos> the lead singer pointed his finger at the crowd <eos> the concert organizer thanked the people for attending.
there was a musical going on downtown today. <eos> there were many popular singers there. <eos> they played a lot of good songs. <eos> the audience was heavily involved. <eos> the singers were very motivational.
the family was camping in a small cabin. <eos> it was a very calm peaceful night. <eos> they started a campfire. <eos> the family sent off some fireworks. <eos> the family went inside and got ready for bed after a long fun day.
there is not much to do in the country. <eos> the couple were looking for something to do. <eos> grandpa said their is a fireworks display going on tonight for fourth of july. <eos> the couple went to the area were there's guna be fireworks. <eos> they enjoyed the fire works show.
my family and i took a vacation to a cabin by the lake for a long weekend. <eos> we enjoyed the peace and quiet away from the city. <eos> we had a campfire and roasted marshmallows. <eos> we let off some ground fireworks. <eos> then we ended the night with some fireworks bright into the sky.
the banger family wanted to spend 4th of july doing something a little different this year. <eos> they always watched fireworks, but then they heard about a haunted firework show. <eos> they went to the show and had a great time being scared by the haunted creatures. <eos> the big finale with the fireworks was very entertaining. <eos> when the family returned from the festivities, they were very glad they went.
our getaway in the outdoors. we love it here. <eos> the night had an eerily beautiful sky. <eos> sitting by the fire is always a good way to relax. <eos> fireworks have always been a hobby of ours, especially out here. <eos> time to relax and enjoy some time indoors. we're sleepy.
i spent a lot of time playing with my friends yesterday. <eos> we all played on my new gaming system. <eos> we played a lot of songs on it. <eos> there was a lot of fun to be had. <eos> afterward we sat together to watch the news.
a man and a woman were playing rock band video game during a party. <eos> more people were taking turn playing the video. <eos> the lady wearing the pink shirt decided to stop playing the video and chatted with other guests. <eos> a man and a woman were amused looking at adults having a good time playing rock band video game. <eos> at the end of the night, guests taking pictures before saying goodbye to each other.
a party was getting underway, with somebody picking up a guitar and playing a song. <eos> now a friend has joined in and is playing music at the party. <eos> one more friend has gotten in on the act and is singing along with her friends' guitar playing. <eos> other guests are enjoying the performance. <eos> afterwards, everyone gathered around the television to watch a show.
there is music being played tonight. <eos> they all got together to have a little jam session. <eos> people are invited over to hang out and have some fun. <eos> people are showing up to share in the festivities of the night. <eos> a great night of music and great company.
our whole family is musical. when we get together at christmas, it turns into an open mic night. john grabs a guitar, <eos> and his wife, jenny, joins him.  <eos> then carly starts singing. <eos> and everybody joins the fun. <eos> when they finally get tired of performing, they drink wine and watch movies.
at this part of the temple, there were men and women eating. <eos> they were holding a sacred ceremony and i was glad to be there. <eos> the candles were spread out on the table. <eos> after enjoying the candles, we went back to the hotel to snap a night picture. <eos> on our way home, we saw decorations in another home.
we waited forever for our food. after we finished eating we decided to walk around. <eos> there were a lot of decorations up for the holidays. <eos> there were some people still doing some last minute shopping. <eos> everything is always so beautiful this time of the year. <eos> after looking at a few more displays we finally headed back home.
the preacher ran a late night christmas mass ceremony. <eos> the nativity scene is still set up. <eos> the candelabra candles are still burning well into the night. <eos> the church lets the people out into the dark night. <eos> with enough time to stop and look at a display window of santa's workshop. 
it's the holiday season. time for a meeting with my fellow workers at the food pantry to decide if we have enough staffing. <eos> then, on to a religious service at the local church that really has a creepy nativity scene this year. <eos> trudging through the snow to find stores that are open.  <eos> enjoying the lights. <eos> finding some inspiration for my last-minute gift-buying.
i chaperoned a field trip to the theater recently. <eos> the play was from the renaissance era. <eos> the stage lighting was very historically accurate. <eos> however, the theater was quite modern-looking. <eos> i thought about the play for a while after i saw it.
it was really cold last night but we managed to climb all the way to the top of the building. <eos> the view of the city from up here was beautiful. <eos> we lit up our balloons and released them into the sky. <eos> we then had to climb all the way back down. <eos> it was very late when we finally arrived home.
we went to the fabled city of lights to see some of the buildings. <eos> this building was always completely lit up no matter what angle you were at! <eos> here is joe showing us how it orks. <eos> the statues were even lit up! <eos> this city is amazing, i wonder what else there is to see!
this is a big white house very castle like. <eos> it can be very spooky if you considering how secluded and dark it is out there. <eos> walking through the streets at this time of night is not dangerous at all. <eos> there is a wall that people feel compelled to stand on, you can see everything from here. <eos> the city is bare with no people on the street, total ghost town.
this building called out to me. i could do nothing but stare for a long time <eos> i started to move around the building to try and find why i was so enraptured by it. <eos> side by side i panned around the building to try and find a source. no luck came for me. <eos> i called my lover over to have her try and find what was going on. <eos> in the end we found a way out, but we worry about others that may have been caught by the stark white of the building.
it was a quiet foggy night in the city. <eos> a few friends decided to go up to the historical inn on the hill overlooking the city and take some photos. <eos> someone also brought a paper lantern to release into the night to honor the orgininal owners of the inn. <eos> while they were preparing the lantern, one of their friends took a picture of the lighted inn. <eos> after they watch the lantern float up into the sky they decided to walk down the road to a small pub to have a night cap.
we had a lot of fun at the canadian rally! <eos> grandma and grampa showed me that there were fireworks! <eos> there was a really neat one that we could see through trees. <eos> there was a huge firework in the sky too! <eos> grandma and grampa loved it! they want to come back to canada next year too!
everyone was excited about my brother's last hockey game of the year. <eos> the crowd was enthusiastic and loudly cheering. <eos> i think mom was more excited than anyone else because she cheered the loudest. <eos> after the game, people sent paper lanterns floating up into the air to celebrate the win. <eos> the night ended with a great firework display.
the hockey players are lined up ready to play after the anthem. <eos> spectators and fans are cheering for their teams. <eos> people are happy when their team scores big. <eos> will he release the balloon light inside or outside. <eos> the light coming through the trees looks inviting.
"going to a hockey game is fun. i like to watch them line up on the ice while the anthem plays. <eos> canadian fans go crazy when they hear ""oh, canada"" <eos> and, go even crazier when their team scores. <eos> after the game, we saw people lighting balloons to celebrate the win. <eos> "and, the city seemed to be celebrating too because there was a fireworks show in the distance. 
it was game day here and we were all gearing up to have a good time. <eos> here we are in our box waiting on the game to start. <eos> at the end of the game they set off fireworks out side. we tried to get some good pics but the trees got in the way. <eos> here is another pic of the fireworks again. i sometimes wish i had a better camera. <eos> at the end our team won. here i am celebrating.
last night's party was really wild. <eos> there were tons of people there. <eos> everyone was being very loud. <eos> some of the party goers may have had too much to drink. <eos> everyone had a great time though.
today was the day that fred was going to ask out the girl of his dreams, at the party! <eos> she said yes! and even kissed him! <eos> everyone was having a great time at the party! <eos> that was until freds new girlfriend was caught kissing another guy. <eos> we decided to stay silent about it.
surprise! happy 21st birthday! <eos> he is thanking his girlfriend for the awesome surprise birthday party. <eos> all of his friends came to celebrate. <eos> his girlfriend is the best and he is so happy. <eos> everyone, including his cousin are having a great time, drinking and being happy.
after finals, we all got together for a party. <eos> of course, jack and diane made out most of the night. <eos> but most of us mingled and partied. <eos> and watched jack and diane make out. <eos> except steve, who drank the night away.
they are having fun with their first kiss. <eos> all the teens are enjoying the party. <eos> one of the teen poses for a picture. <eos> the party is a blast. you can see as this young man poses. <eos> smiling as he enjoys the party with his friends.
last night's party was so much fun. <eos> there were a lot of beers. <eos> we all had a lot to drink. <eos> afterward everyone started playing drinking games. <eos> i'm not sure if there was anyone able to drive.
casie and shauna went to the mall to find boyfriends. <eos> they scoped the area out but had no luck at the mall. <eos> they went to the bar next to try their luck! <eos> shauna was eyed by a lesbian from across the bar. <eos> shauna now drinks heavily because she cannot find a boyfriend
kat and michelle really know how to put on a party. <eos> they invited loads of people. <eos> there were drinking games. <eos> even the wallflowers had fun. <eos> and, some people had a lot of fun!
two roommates decided to dress up and have a party for christmas. <eos> their friends came and were socializing with each other. <eos> the guys decided it would be a great idea to set up some cups for beer pong. <eos> everyone appeared to be having a great time. <eos> they even broke out the champagne they were saving for new years and decided to share the bottle.
everyone is enjoying the party. <eos> everyone has a drink in their hand! <eos> there were a lot of people who showed up to the party. <eos> everyone comes to get a drink. <eos> there were plenty of drinks for everyone.
i love animals and i like coming to the zoo to see my favorite ones. <eos> i love the monkeys because they're cute and do funny things. <eos> i love the elephants because they breath through their trunk, which i think is pretty strange. <eos> i love the zebras because they look a lot like a striped horse. <eos> but the animals i love most are my two best friends that are waiting for me to come home.
the family took a train ride to the zoo today. <eos> the little boy was excited once he got to the zoo. <eos> they went on the sky lift to see the animals below. <eos> they saw all kinds off elephants below. <eos> they loved seeing the zebras.
the family went our month trip to the zoo. <eos> the little ones are always the most excited. <eos> the view from the chair ride is always really cool. <eos> the whole family loves seeing the elephants. <eos> my favorite animal has always been the zebra,
today we visited the zoo. <eos> it was our first time seeing an animal like this one. <eos> the elephants were fun to watch. <eos> the zebras were not very active. <eos> when we arrived home the dogs were waiting patiently for us.
took my kid out to the zoo. he was mesmerized by all the animals there.  <eos> this little guy was adorable! he kept coming to the window at us. <eos> elephants are such amazing creatures. they're so intelligent. <eos> they even had zebras there! i've never seen one this close before. <eos> and we ended the day relaxing with our very own animals at home.
i visited my sister and her husband this weekend. <eos> she doesn't like having her picture taken. <eos> we helped set up the christmas tree. <eos> after the christmas tree was set up we went out for dinner. <eos> after dinner we went back to their place where she showed us her flaming hula hoop trick.
meeting new people at parties is something we all love to do. <eos> people gathered in the kitchen getting drinks and chatting. <eos> my mate standing next to the christmas tree lit up with lights. <eos> torches in a row leading to the backyard.  <eos> fire dancers lit their hoops and put on quite a show. 
its new years eve and a group of friends are having a party. <eos> they are mixing all kinds of drinks in the kitchen. <eos> a gentleman poses by the christmas tree for a photo. <eos> the group then moves to the backyard where the owners of the home have prepared a special treat. <eos> there is a performance by a fire dancer right before midnight for everyone to enjoy.
harry and sally's christmas party was going swell so far.  <eos> lots of punk friends and whatnot, it was pretty unorthodox compared to a traditional christmas party. <eos> harry's brother clearly isn't very good at taking pictures.  <eos> instead of just hanging around the tree we went outside for a surprise.... <eos> fire swinging performance. it was pretty exciting. 
our first christmas in australia felt strange. i wasn't used to the summer christmas weather. <eos> my wife gemma worked hard to make it a special day. she had a surprise for me. <eos> she had put up a big christmas tree, a type that didn't grow naturally here! <eos> she also invited over a lot of my american friends to make me feel more at home. <eos> i didn't even mind the part of the party that took place outside in the heat!
the photographer of the series thought quite abstractly. <eos> she did portraits, but only in black in white. <eos> many of her photographs were simply patterns and she rarely offered explanations of why she chose to put these on display. <eos> the people she photographed seemed to have vibrant personalities that brought light to the pictures. <eos> the rare color photograph she took was still quite unusual.
a deep square room, the has all the mystery that one could think of.  <eos> as we start to walk down the pathway from that room we come upon this odd looking room as well.  <eos> we turn left and find another mystical room with a door to go to another. <eos> as we walk through we come to the open area of an art museum. <eos> we end our mystical trip back outside of the hall of wonders.
i had a dream i was going down a long tunnel with a light at the end. <eos> above were lights. or were they stars? <eos> i finally found myself in a bright room. <eos> when things came into focus, i saw strange alien sculptures. <eos> i ran away from that building as fast as i could!
sarah was embarking on a day of accumulating some more of her photographic art. <eos> her first subject was a portrait of a man in a hat. the backgrounds is stark adding to the artistic expression of the photo. <eos> next, sarah took a photo of still art. she appreciated the pattern seemingly extending forever. <eos> back to a live subject, she selected a female with a sense of motion in the photo. <eos> the last item was another still art with a pattern that fascinated sarah. she was comfortable with the mix of portraits and still art she created.
jessica started working on her new trailer for the big video premiere. <eos> she had lots of great footage of the main character, rob. <eos> she mixed that footage with some artsy scenes of the room that most of the story took place. <eos> lena, the other main girl, also made an appearance. <eos> when the trailer was done, jessica printed some stills of the frames and took them to the local art gallery.
me and a few coworkers decided to go out for happy hour. <eos> my assistant was thrilled because she was tired from working so much and needed some relaxation. <eos> to my fellow coworkers couldn't wait to sit at the bar and have drinks. <eos> my two bosses were really enjoying themselves. <eos> it started getting late and we realized we didn't even have dinner yet.
while eating lunch and waiting was in conversation with a friend of mine. <eos> a storm started to roll in as we were finishing our meal.  <eos> a shot of the skyline as it started to cloud over. <eos> the ships started to pull in as the sun started to set.  <eos> a ferris wheel stretching up towards the sky so tall. 
the party we went to was a lot of fun. <eos> it was rainy outside but we were very dry inside. <eos> i met a lot of new and interesting people there. <eos> afterward we got together to exchange contact information. <eos> once night started to fall people started leaving.
a nice business meeting was set up on a cold october day. <eos> lilly an intern for one of the leading companies was having a drink with a few associates to hand in some paperwork. <eos> during her dinner a few old friends approached her and asked if they could join. <eos> the two associates loved making new friends and welcomed the females. <eos> they had a nice dinner and ended the night with a boat ride.
me and my lover went on a vacation to see some sights. here we are getting something to eat.  <eos> we liked the food but the place was rather crowded for our tastes. <eos> here is a view of the city from our hotel. it was so lovely to look out every night as the sun went down. <eos> another shot from high up. it was breath taking to watch the city light up as the sun went down. <eos> we where in line for a ferris wheel. i thought that this would make a good pic, and i think it came out well.
we had been working hard all week to finish building our space ball. <eos> we had to wait forever to get all of the panels assembled. <eos> we had to climb all over the structure. <eos> it was really difficult to fasten them all in place. <eos> after a long time we finally finished it.
tony started to make aluminum sculptures. <eos> once he started he could not stop, he mad huge creations. <eos> he made a triforce but took it a step further. <eos> now it's a giant aluminum ball! <eos> to this day it stands in central park!
here we viewed the making of a giant glass decorative ball.  <eos> each small triangle piece was carefully put into place.  <eos> the individual triangles made larger triangles which would then be put together as a large ball-like ornament.  <eos> it was high anxiety waiting for that last piece to be put into place. <eos> the final outcome was amazing; so decorative and elegant looking. 
creating a geodesic dome out of glass is a painstaking process. <eos> the tiny triangles all have to be fitted together precisely. <eos> these, then, form larger triangles <eos> which are then fitted together to make the dome. <eos> in the end, all that's left is to take a picture of this unique structure.
there is a mission to build something unique. a piece of art that really stands out. <eos> although it has taken time and piece by piece it seems to get harder, it still gets done. <eos> the men hold together a triangle base for each piece. <eos> careful to not drop the art, the men focus hard on the outcome. <eos> in conclusion the art piece stands tall and beautiful, proving that hard work goes a long way.
as i was waiting for my brother to have dinner with me i had me a cappuccino and was reading my favorite book. <eos>  i kept waiting at the bar for my brother he took a long time. <eos> my brother finally came and we got seated. <eos>  for dinner i ordered some kind of meatball soup. <eos> my brother decided just to have some kind of egg cold beef sandwich.
we had all gone out for lunch yesterday. <eos> after we finished eating we decided to walk around for a little bit. <eos> there were a lot of interesting shops that we passed by. <eos> afterward we decided to grab some dinner at another restaurant. <eos> they had some strange food there.
trying a new restaurant is always scary, but i was determined to write a review for my blog, so i sat down at a table with a magazine and ordered a cappuccino. <eos> the bar was fully stocked and had several beers on tap. <eos> the ambiance was understated, and created an air of intimacy in the small space. <eos> the menu was expansive, some of the foods, like this dish drawing upon asian influences. <eos> other dishes had a decidedly mediterranean flair.
dining out in a foreign country is always an experience. they put salt in our hot chocolate, and when we asked why, they handed us a book about salt. <eos> the pubs have a million different beers, and they are all warm. <eos> sometimes the dining areas have an interesting ambience...like this place where we ate in a hallway. <eos> this soup i tried was pretty good though i'm not sure what was in it. <eos> but, i wasn't a fan of hard-boiled eggs on my sandwich.
today, our friends gathered together for some food after work. <eos> we arrived somewhat early, so things weren't too packed yet. <eos> however, that quickly changed, and things became quite busy!  <eos> the food provided was amazingly delicious. <eos> subs and other sandwiches were also available on the menu.
new york city is bustling during the day. <eos> as nighttime draws near on new years eve in nyc the bustling and energy rise to an all time high. <eos> traffic and people make their way to times square. <eos> people from all over the country and world come to times square to watch the new years eve countdown. <eos> "the scream ""five, four, three, two, one...happy new year!""

today we decided to go to the city. <eos> we found some very large buildings that we hadn't seen before. <eos> the night sky was beautiful when the sun went down. <eos> there were a lot of cool decorations that lit up at night! <eos> i want to come back to the city tomorrow, but now i must sleep.
i love to see famous buildings, although i usually can't remember all the names. but i can always name the empire state building. <eos> i saw a building like this in san francisco. i'm not sure if this is it or not, but it might be.  <eos> i know i have never visited this city because the skyscraper is not familiar to me. it is lit with red and green lights. maybe it's christmas. <eos> i'm not sure where this is either but i believe it is new year's eve. looks like a brand new year. <eos> happy new year! welcome 2007!
taking a tour of famous buildings in the city. i remembered this one from a tv show. <eos> the dome on this one was marvelous. <eos> we couldn't stop to go in any more since it was night, but we got to see the empire state building from a distance, <eos> and the courthouse all lit up with the american flag. <eos> unfortunately, the last stop on our tour took us past this ugly paragon of advertisement.
new york, new york baby! <eos> inside some cool ass building! <eos> time square at dusk <eos> night time x-mas, only new york style. <eos> happy new york year
the venue was very comfortable.  <eos> some of my friends played the dancing game. <eos> they played for about an hour. <eos> my coworkers talked over drinks. <eos> the ride back was enlightening. 
in our vacation to new york city we got on a subway for the first time. <eos> it was so crowded people were pushing and shoving. <eos> we couldn't find a place to sit so we had to stand and we held on to the poles. <eos> as soon as some people got up to get off at the next stop i sat by a girl who had huge pink and blue sunglasses.  <eos> i gave carlos a look from the corner of my eye and we laughed.
i tried to get on the train as fast as i could. <eos> there were too many people inside. <eos> i eventually made it in but it was very crowded. <eos> i couldn't believe how many people were on the train. <eos> it took a long time but we eventually made it off.
the subway is an economical way to get from point a to point b.  <eos> a lot of young people prefer the subway.  <eos> sometimes it's standing room only. <eos> you might see someone you know.  <eos> a neighbor or close friend could be right by you on the subway. 
drake had a plan the day of the celebration. <eos> he set up dance dance revolution for his friend. <eos> his friend danced with his younger sister for a while. <eos> tricia was there because her and drake were friends since second grade. <eos> rachel was on the bus on the way to drake's house.
we decided to let the little man invite all of his friends over for a party. <eos> this is his best friend andy, who had a few to many drinks that night. <eos> there was a bunch of lasagna for the party and everyone had seconds. <eos> little man was scooped up by his woman as soon as she entered the door.  <eos> we finished off the party with a bunch of fondue.
baby noah came home after two weeks in the hospital we were so happy he was all better. <eos> we were so excited we decided to throw a welcome home party for him. <eos> aunt cathy sang to noah. <eos> uncle rob tried to get noah to pose for a picture but he was too interested in other things that were going on in the room. <eos> like patricia's laugh that everyone finds so annoying.
when i got to my parent's house they were very happy to see me. <eos> they had invited a bunch of friend and family over for dinner. <eos> there was a lot of food there. <eos> there were many babies too. <eos> the food was delicious.
the little baby was excited to play with his family members at the reunion.  <eos> everyone got in line for the food, <eos> and then everyone passed around the baby. <eos> he even got his uncle to hold him for a little while. <eos> great fun and many laughs were had by all. 
baby isaac had a family that cared for him deeply. <eos> his father already set up a trust fund in isaac's name.  <eos> a weekend family party is a regular thing for isaac's family. <eos> he fell asleep in his aunt's arms. <eos> the final treat of the night was a fondue dish. 
our friends got together this weekend to celebrate new years. <eos> we got pretty drunk and loud, mike was trying to eat his shirt. <eos> we made sure everyone had a drink at all times, we didn't want any sobriety in this house.  <eos> we blew our noise makers when the time came. <eos> but, the city didn't look much different, still the same city even in the new year.
i went to the bar to meet my friends yesterday. <eos> they were all very happy to see me. <eos> everyone was enjoying themselves. <eos> afterward we all went for a walk outside. <eos> there were a lot of lights at night.
me and by boyfriend garrett had a great time out in the freezing weather party. <eos> our friend nathalie was crazy that night! <eos> here's tootie and her boyfriend jo. <eos> and here's me and garrett again, with my ex-boyfriend blair in the background. <eos> the cityscape view from the party was spectacular.
the whole gang went out last night in the extreme cold. <eos> i must say sasha got a little drunk. <eos> betty, jerry and max were all hitting the whisky pretty heavily. <eos> james had a cigar, too. <eos> it was a good night, and looking at the city in the dark was pretty cool.
john and carl have been friends for all of their life. they hung out every weekend. <eos> this weekend they decided to go to a beach party in brooklyn, new york. they new the bird lady would be there. she loved to party. <eos> kendra also came out to party with them. she loved mixing drinks and getting toasty. <eos> john and carl would fill their pipes with tobacco and mingle with everyone there. <eos> at the end of the night people would be passed out in the sand, while those who were still awake would admire the dark nights skyline.
there were several plates to choose from. <eos> the band played for hours. <eos> they had both originals and covers. <eos> the guests ate endlessly that night. <eos> and played with the music set when the band was done.
i went to a bar and my friens' band was playing there. <eos> i took a seat up front. <eos> soon enough, he noticed i was there. <eos> he came over to say hi. <eos> we talked and he ended up joining us for dinner.
it was my bands first big break. <eos> we got a gig playing at the local bar for a night. <eos> needless to say we were stoked. <eos> we took tons of promotional photos. <eos> and then had a great dinner after to celebrate. 
the food at the restaurant was delicious. <eos> they also had a live band. <eos> they were very good. <eos> we took a lot of pictures of that night. <eos> we also were able to chat with some of the band members.
i saw my son's band play at a bar. <eos> his drummer is named roman. <eos> roman is very polite if you are polite to him. <eos> when you are not polite to roman, he insults you and your son. <eos> afterward, roman acts overly polite and tries to scare you with how friendly he is. 
friday we moved in to our new home. we bought some pizzas to celebrate with friends and family. <eos> little mich brought the ice for the sodas. <eos> although we only had only two chairs out the place was starting to feel like home. <eos> mom helped organize the mess we had all over. what would i do with ought her. <eos> everyone was so tired by the move that we just had to take a break. 
my son wanted to help with the ice. <eos> inside the room, the man spoke business.  <eos> outsidex they talked about life. <eos> the couple was happy to be there.  <eos> the couple's son was adorable. 
this husband and wife were excited to have a pizza night at their new place. <eos> their son made sure to get the ice ready for drinks, <eos> and grandpa made sure that the chairs were set up. <eos> everyone started arriving, <eos> and enjoyed the couple's new home. 
our friends were happy to see the pizza on the kitchen tabletop. <eos> our kid brought out the ice for the drinks. <eos> dad relaxed on a chair with a beer in his hand. <eos> family and friends were ready to gather and talk. <eos> lastly, we enjoyed the day with company and drinks.
we were all very hungry, so we ordered a bunch of pizza. <eos> the little guy wanted to help with lunch, so we let him carry the ice! <eos> grandpa rested by a fan. <eos> as everyone came in, we brought out the boxed wine. <eos> we all sat down together and enjoyed some wine.
the dj entertained that evening. <eos> he was a favorite with the crowd. <eos> there were plenty of festive drinks. <eos> the new year was welcomed with style. <eos> karaoke was popular among those that liked an audience.
we attended an awesome new year's eve party. <eos> the drinks were flowing fast and furious. <eos> the two dj's kept us dancing until the big event.  <eos> finally it was time! the place exploded in celebration. <eos> happy new year! 
i had to go out and buy a lot of beer for the party but they were sold out. <eos> we decided to go to a bar instead since we could not get any beer. <eos> there were only tow bartenders that night. <eos> after that we left and drove to a lounge to relax. <eos> we had a great time there.
so we went to our local pub for a new years bash. <eos> todd our favorite bartender was there for the night giving us great discounts. <eos> as well as nate and derrick two local djs. <eos> though it was raining out it didnt kill the mood. <eos> the party inside was plenty wild.
a dj gets ready to perform. <eos> he poses with his friend. <eos> they look for a place to sit. <eos> they then proceed to dance and party. <eos> a woman sings.
i had so much food to eat yesterday. <eos> i went to visit my family. <eos> all of the relatives were there. <eos> we all had a great time. <eos> the dessert was especially good.
a big meal is prepared.  <eos> everyone pitches in to make the meal and everyone enjoys.  <eos> the family is together celebrating an occasion.  <eos> the boys pose with the birthday cake.  <eos> the family enjoys each other's company. 
hu had a party at his parents' house the other night. <eos> there was tons of food, and his mom was anxious that everybody enjoy themselves. <eos> everyone had a good time talking and laughing. then, hu's brother brought out a birthday cake for hu. <eos> he lit the candles while people cheered. <eos> then everybody dug into the delicious-looking cake.
today is miko's birthday, he is turning twenty one years old. <eos> our closest family and friends have come together to spend this special day with him. <eos> mico never realized how many family members he has, as everybody poses for a picture. <eos> mico holds up his birthday cake with his cousin john. <eos> after the party everybody relaxes watching some television. 
a variety of food was spread over the table. <eos> the host was finally able to get a plate for herself. <eos> everyone gathered in the front room to take pictures. <eos> the birthday recipients each held up the cake. <eos> it wasn't long before people were relaxed in conversation on the floor.
my smart cat was looking for a book to read. <eos> my bad cat asked him if he wanted to get drunk. <eos> my smart cat gave my bad cat a dirty look. <eos> my bad cat gave him a disdainful look in return. <eos> my other cat often enjoys listening to them argue.
my cat does not like to have pictures taken with him in it. <eos> oh no he spotted me! that's not good! <eos> he turned me into the police and i was arrested next to this watch out sign! <eos> we now all walk out of our apartment, homeless. <eos> we need to find a new home. also we can't have cats anymore. court order.
city life for this literary cat is hard. <eos> he had to find the perfect time to make his break for the door. <eos> he then has to avoid construction on the sidewalk <eos> and dodge pedestrians. <eos> his most difficult task, though, is figuring out which of the people at the park might share their lunch with him.
this cat likes to wait for mice that may lurk between the books. <eos> oh, oh the cat see's that she is being watched and is suspicious. <eos> if this floor is slippery then you better watch your step. <eos> that guy seems to be jaywalking and that is illegal. <eos> a restful seat in the park for two lovely couples after a busy day.
it's great being the bookstore cat, i feel so literate! <eos> oh yeah? it's way better being the liquor store cat! i feel sooo meow lol fft <eos> who do you think you are? <eos> i'm catman, who the hell are you? <eos> would you two shut up and help me knit a sweater?
my friends and i went to a conference about three miles away. <eos> i took several pictures with associates. <eos> the living room was very well furnished. <eos> i also had a great time exploring the hallway. <eos> before we went to sleep, i took this picture with one of my friends.
pete and ben are talented artists. they decided to throw a party so friends could come over and see their artwork. <eos> the party goers were most impressed with how beautifully decorated the apartment was for the big event. <eos> they had some snacks, drinks, and chatted a bit before admiring more of the beautiful sculptures in other rooms. <eos> they loved the warm glow of the lights on the giant crucifix. it was a favorite of the guests.  <eos> the party was so successful pete and ben had to end it before guests decided to crash on pete's elegant and very comfy bed!
i went to a house party to visit with friends. <eos> there were a few friends i hadn't seen in a while.  <eos> it was really great to catch up with them.  <eos> i saw some really nice displays as i wandered around the house. <eos> but it ended up being a crazier party than i expected and a bunch of us had to spend the night. 
i was invited to my friend's new home. he was a terrific artist.  <eos> many of our childhood friends came too, it was like a reunion.  <eos> the whole house had a artsy vibe to it.  <eos> a lot of religious symbolism scattered about.  <eos> who says you can't have a sleep over in an artist's house?
the old law school friends gathered together. <eos> they sat around in the living room reminising about the past. <eos> the guys got together for a picture, to recreate their first pictures together. <eos> it seemed as though the party had broken up... <eos> however everyone had migrated to the bedroom to debate cotton vs flannel sheets.
last holiday, we gathered at my moms. <eos> she had a wide variety of fruit and drinks. <eos> i brought our baby along in celebration. <eos> my neighbor also came and had a lot of fun with us. <eos> towards the end of the night, we took a group picture.
the family gathered in the sitting room for a gathering before the party. <eos> next, they went to the dining room to have a nice meal. <eos> they then went to have classy drinks to start the party. <eos> some of them then put on party hats for the birthday celebration. <eos> one of the people even had a noisemaker for the celebration.
for 2015 there was a nice family gathering. young and old enjoyed the night.  <eos> at the grown up table they ate and drank well with good conversation too. <eos> the cocktails seemed delightful. <eos> there was a mom, dad, and little baby who especially enjoyed themselves.  <eos> then the night ended with party favors and smiles. 
the family were preparing for the upcoming costume party. <eos> tom was putting his bartending license to good use to make sure the adult had some great drinks. <eos> all the invited guest were having a good time. <eos> a lot of guest really got into the spirit of the party. <eos> the family had a great time. all the planning and efforts seem to work out. 
the family went to their parents' house on new year eve. <eos> the boy's grandparents served the family dinner. <eos> they had champagne, wine, gin and tonic and some other drinks. <eos> the family then decided to go out. <eos> they wanted to celebrate new year eve with other people on the street.
at this fine bar, we hosted a party for our friend. <eos> he was coming back from another country and we made him a centerpiece. <eos> the tables were also decorated in his honor. <eos> my aunt and mom came from another state to celebrate too. <eos> we took a picture of the important men at the event.
kate and lisa decided to go to the new year's eve party this year. <eos> at the party, a bartender was there to take their order. <eos> waiters in the back worked to prepare trays of drinks for them. <eos> there were also tables of snacks for them to eat. <eos> the party even had decorative hats for them to wear.
the place cards had been laid. <eos> the decorations had been put up. <eos> the party favors were organized on the tables. <eos> as the guests arrived, the were handed drinks. <eos> the only thing left to do was eat and enjoy the party.
the bar was rented out for tom and joy's anniversary party. <eos> the bar wasted no expense to make the party feel special. <eos> the table was set to make sure all party favors were available. <eos> joe enjoyed the party with her friends. <eos> tom was happy hanging with his friends. everyone had a memorable time. 
sharon and macy met tom for an event at a restaurant downtown. <eos> the restaurant was inviting. <eos> tom, himself, passed around appetizers,  <eos> and there were wonderful cheese plates to sample. <eos> sharon and macy declined wearing the hats, though.
we had a great time on vacation last weekend. <eos> we spent the entire day hiking in the wilderness. <eos> we took a lot of photos of nature. <eos> after hiking for a while we came across a road. <eos> the view around us was complete desolate.
i visited my parents in wisconsin this week. <eos> the weather was cold and snowy. <eos> we took the dog out for a walk but needed to get away from the road. <eos> we started to wander through the words worried that the dog would get cold. <eos> the dog loved the snow and laid right down and it.
the family came out to enjoy the first snowfall the town has received in 10 years. <eos> the young child was seeing snow for the first time. <eos> the wooded area covered in snow made for a perfect background. <eos> even the family dog was stunned by the snow. <eos> the entire town was under a blanket of snow for the first time in years.
my family went for a hike on a snowy day in the woods. <eos> mom loves to take pictures of me. <eos> dad loves to take pictures of me and mom. <eos> my dog doesn't like to get his picture taken. <eos> it was nice to be back in the warm car driving home.
the family went for their annual winter vacation. <eos> they took turn posing for pictures. <eos> dad was taking a picture of his wife, his daughter and the family's dog. <eos> the family walked around enjoying the snow. <eos> the lake appeared to be frozen.
we had been begging for a great apartment. <eos> one with an open floor plan... <eos> and a beautiful kitchen.  <eos> well, we were completely surprised when this one had a washer and a dryer... <eos> and, was a beautiful home from the outside. we signed the papers immediately.
i just bought a new house last week. <eos> it very nice inside. <eos> it is very clean. <eos> i moved all the furniture in yesterday. <eos> i still need to buy some more.
moving into a new house.  <eos> we will need to paint the walls.  <eos> not much food yet.  <eos> plenty of laundry will be done.  <eos> we will be growing a garden in the front yard. 
our living room looked really great. <eos> the decorator did an amazing job with the floor. <eos> the kitchen looked really great with the wood cabinets. <eos> everything was really interesting to see. <eos> even the outside of the house looked great.
we were given a tour of the new house. <eos> the first stop was the kitchen. <eos> the kitchen has a nice setup with the range centrally located. <eos> the master bedroom was very large with nice lighting. <eos> next we saw the updated bathroom and it was huge!
the committee was getting ready for an important meeting. <eos> bob greeted ted, a new committe member. <eos> they were starting to sit down. <eos> the cameras were ready. <eos> soon the dicussion was underway.
so here we are, ready to hear what the government is up to these days. <eos> a sign on the wall as you walk into the conference hall. <eos> the name tags of the speakers directing them to their seats. <eos> the news reporter brings in his big camera. <eos> the court-reporter takes her position about to transcribe each word.
we are having a meeting today on rules and regulations. <eos> the committee has gathered for the first time this year <eos> we are all getting ready to talk. <eos> once we are seated the speakers take the stage. <eos> then the board starts to make a ruling on the desicions
the committee on rules and administration has a lot to decide today. <eos> mr. whithers is pushing to get a lot changed for the better. <eos> it's hard to say just who is on his side this day. <eos> the eyes of the community are on them as deliberate. <eos> it will be hard to convince his colleagues of these changes.
today the committee of rules is meeting. <eos> they are going to be hearing from 4 people today in 4 cases. <eos> this is the first time they are meeting in 2 months so they have a lot to discuss. <eos> it is also going to be taped for public tv! <eos> the committee sits down to begin hearing cases.
one day, amy decided that she was craving some food from johnny's big red grill. <eos> so she went inside to get her some grub. <eos> but when she looked at the menu, there were so many choices! <eos> and everything looked so good! <eos> but in the end, amy was able to decide on a nice, juicy hamburger.
the cafe was open late. <eos> john entered the empty cafe just before they closed. <eos> he perused the menu to decide what to order. <eos> the burger looked and tasted delicious. <eos> the next morning, though, john had a stomach ache.
a great dinner at the local sandwich shop. <eos> inside all the fresh ingredients are in full view for the customers. <eos> the menu is big with a delicious selection. <eos> the food is made to order exactly for each customers preference. <eos> customers always go home feeling satisfied with their meal.
after we got through traffic we finally made it to the restaurant. <eos> we were so hungry so we all knew exactly what to order. <eos> their menu is huge. <eos> the food in the display case was making my mouth water. <eos> i ordered the biggest burger they had and it was amazing.
ooh, johnny's might make for a good meal. <eos> stepping in and i'm excited for the choices. <eos> i'm so overwhelmed by the menu options but glad that they don't just make two things. <eos> the food looks fresh and my mouth is getting watery. <eos> finally i have my food and i'm ready to pig out.
i was lost and about to be late to work. <eos> i drove around as fast as i could until i found the school. <eos> at one point i went in the wrong direction and was outside of the city. <eos> fortunately i finally found the school and made it to class just in time. <eos> i quickly started the lesson.
there once was a couple who prayed for a bundle of joy. <eos> and then one day, that bundle of joy arrived! <eos> she grew up to be a sweet girl! <eos> who made crazy faces, <eos> and loved the spotlight.
the sun was rising over the lake. <eos> the baby started to fuss and she woke her sister up. <eos> big sister decided she wanted to wear her favorite pink shirt. <eos> she didn't want her mom to comb her curly hair. <eos> she was disappointed that her mom wouldn't let her have pancakes for breakfast.
exploring under the highways exposed a barren side of the land. <eos> we loved the view out of the window. <eos> we even went to check out the outskirts of the city. <eos> our classes were always interesting. <eos> the teacher gave it her all in lessons.
i was so tired of looking at the dingy city. i needed a change. <eos> i'm up for a road trip. goodbye hustle and bustle. <eos> ah...fresh air! i can feel myself relaxing already. <eos> that trip was great and i've returned to work with new energy. <eos> "i""m enjoying my class so much more now. maybe i should get away more often."
the students gathered on the yellow school bus for a trip to the big apple! <eos> they were excited to see all the attractions while driving around downtown. <eos> they crossed over a bridge and looked down at the water below. <eos> the bus driver let them off to explore the pier by the water. <eos> they ended their trip by staring off into the cool calm waters. 
the class field trip to new york was a delightful experience. <eos> first, we went out to the pier, where some tried there hand at fishing. <eos> others just took in the great views of the skyline. <eos> then there was the infamous hustle and bustle of wall street. <eos> new york city has so much to offer.
i hopped in my bus last thursday to being work. <eos> there was a field trip today so i had to work extra. <eos> i took the bus across the bridge and we all went the pier. <eos> everybody had a good time there. <eos> the water was so bright and we could see the city in the distance.
the school buses take the kids on a trip through the city. <eos> looking out over the river can be a calming experience. <eos> speaking of calming, one can gaze out upon the river and see the city. <eos> wall street is where the magic happens... and the lying, cheating, and stealing. <eos> new york, a great city.
it all started that morning as i got ready to go to school. <eos> but, just before i left, my dad said we were skipping and going on a trip to the city and beyond! <eos> we went across a huge bridge! <eos> then we took a walk and watched some people who were fishing.  <eos> after our walk, we took a break and stared at the beautiful city skyline. 
after i woke up yesterday i went to head to the farm. <eos> i wanted to see all the horses there. <eos> i took a shortcut through the alleys. <eos> when i got to the barn the horse was glad to see me. <eos> i brushed him.
dale moved to miami this past weekend. <eos> dale is living in an apartment close to the beach. <eos> all around dale's apartment are some massive mansions that celebrities live in. <eos> dale thinks he is gonna like living in miami. <eos> dale spends most of his time now out on the beach catching some rays and relaxing.
there are many shops and businesses near the shore. <eos> the graffiti on this building seems to actually be an improvement.  <eos> this house really has a tropical look with the palm trees surrounding it.  <eos> the streets seem to be quite this time of day, wonder where all the people are? <eos> it is very relaxing looking out over the water and listening to the waves. 
looking at the art work on the wall. <eos> here we are trying to figure out what we are going to do next. <eos> here is where my cousin lives. <eos> one of my horses looking happy. <eos> here is the other love of my life.
i visited south america last week with my family. <eos> my parent's and i had never been out of the country. <eos> we rented a car for our trip. <eos> our hotel ended up being a barn. <eos> with cute little horses living in the yard.
the day began with a conversation in the hallway. <eos> the office was very laid back. <eos> our secretary made most of the calls. <eos> the boss was happy to be there too. <eos> we drew a diagram as a department.
just taking a break while i decide what project to start on next. <eos> i can't be bothered to talk, i'm brokering a big deal. <eos> the view from my office, how stunning. <eos> standing outside the nbc studio in san diego. <eos> two co-workers chat about the big new project coming to the studio.
the work environment is very friendly at my new job.  <eos> although, some are more serious than others.  <eos> the view from my office makes it all worth it.  <eos> i'd say, working for nbc san diego is very rewarding.  <eos> my boss seems to appreciate me and even gave me a raise. 
mike and jessica talk about the seating and office arrangements for the new office. <eos> amber and john love mike and jessica's ideas. <eos> larry calls in melany to get help on organizing the new seating charts and office rooms. <eos> melany uses her computer and figures up different ways to set up the offices and seats. <eos> after working hard she displays the office chart on the way. everybody has their own chairs and office.
arriving to work my first day as an intern, i overheard two accountants having a discussion in the hallway. <eos> i then went to see my boss and his assistant to find out what i needed to do. <eos> i waited for one of the partners to get off the phone so i could ask for the file needed. <eos> i then took the file to the business manager so she could input the information from the file into the firm's computer system. <eos> then, she gave me a diagram to put in the conference room as a reference for the staff meeting at the end of the day.
i went with my friend to the concert last week. <eos> we were both very excited. <eos> it was our first concert together. <eos> we were very impressed by all of the lights. <eos> we had a great time there.
the come up presented shad last night. <eos> i got to go backstage and meet him. <eos> we talked for about an hour about his music. <eos> he had the crowd on their feet the minute he took the stage. <eos> his set was awesome.
doing interviews will always be a part of the business. <eos> i have to admit though, i like it better once the interview is over and we can kick back for a minute. <eos> it's great when the interviewer is also a fan. <eos> performing in front of a crowd has always got my adrenaline pumping. <eos> it's easy to feed off of a good crowd.
my brother and i had our first concert together. <eos> him and i said a prayer before we went out on stage. <eos> we put on our game face and braved the crowd. <eos> the concert was fun, the light show was the best. <eos> everyone in the crowd had a great time and enjoyed our music.
jerome and i are headed out to a concert. <eos> we meet up at my place. <eos> we are excited before we go out to see our favorite rapper. <eos> once the show started it was amazing. <eos> the show went on the rest of the night.
the table of food was a pleasure to see! <eos> our food is both nutritious and beautiful! <eos> the work of art that was our chicken was especially tasty! <eos> we love greens as they taste great and are healthy! <eos> the fruit was a colorful display that tantalized our palette.
the able is ready for the party.  <eos> first appetizer is fried fish. <eos> then we have a noodle salad. <eos> there is also the option of a fruit bowl for kids.  <eos> and finally for desert, coconut cakes. 
last week i made so much food for the party i wasn't sure if everyone was going to be able to finish it. <eos> i thought i might have made too much. <eos> i was cooking all day. <eos> eventually i had to save some of them as leftovers. <eos> but everyone finished all of the dessert.
the buffet had so much food to choose from. <eos> there was the kind for people that eat healthy. <eos> there was kind for people more interested in meat. <eos> there was kinds that people had no idea about. <eos> and there was fruit that was very nice to look at and looked delicious.
today there was a food taste testing! <eos> a featured dish was a salad made of several different kinds of greens. <eos> to compliment the salad, a chicken dish was also featured. <eos> another vegetable dish to add variation to the testing was available. <eos> for dessert: a fruit platter!
last week i decided to drive out into the city to visit the cemetery. <eos> it was deep in downtown so i had to drive through rush hour traffic to get there. <eos> when i got there i made sure to read every gravestone that i passed by. <eos> there were so many graves there. <eos> i didn't have time to visit all of them.
they went to washington dc on a trip. <eos> they could see the capitol building from their hotel. <eos> they could also see the national mall. <eos> they went to pay their respects to their fallen relatives. <eos> the flag at half mast made them feel less alone in their grief.
as missy visited washington dc, she realized there was so much to see. <eos> this included the jefferson memorial, the white house, and the main reason for going; arlington cemetery. <eos> missy started with a tribute that had a message prior to entering the cemetery. <eos> missy looked up and down many rows of tombs.  <eos> she was amazed at the amount of true veterans that were laid to rest here.
looking at the washington monument on out bedroom window.  <eos> also was able to see the capitol. <eos> then we went to visit the arlington national cemetery.  <eos> walking through the cemetery. <eos> in the end we placed a red roses at the grave of a special fallen soldier, our grandfather. 
i love the view from my hotel room.  <eos> i can see lots of famous buildings and i'm located in the center of town.  <eos> my favorite structure is this tower. <eos> unfortunately today i have not solemn plans on my agenda.  <eos> paying a visit to the graveyards of soldiers that fought for our county. 
my new computers arrived today so it's time to set up. <eos> i cleaned and arranged the desk to accommodate all the new equipment. <eos> i made sure it was all in order ready for set up. <eos> most of it is set up here, but there are last minute arrangements. <eos> all set; my new computers!
i finally got my new computer. <eos> i was waiting for days. <eos> i had to set it all up. <eos> it took me a while to put them all up. <eos> i had a lot of garbage afterward.
we're setting up our home business today. <eos> it will take a lot of work, <eos> but the outcome will be worth it. <eos> we set up new computers, <eos> and donated the older ones.
the students were very excited to see the arrival of their new computer equipment. <eos> they had waited a long time and finally, tim, the consultant, was on site to start the installation. <eos> tim worked hard to insure that all the computers were setup correctly. <eos> he tested each one to make sure it could connect to the internet and had all the necessary programs installed. <eos> at last the new computer lab was set up and working, and just waiting for the students to take their seats.
i recently ordered a bunch of new computers for my home office. <eos> i also bought new desks so that i had a place to put the computers. <eos> the desks were surprisingly dusty so i spent at least 30 minutes cleaning them. <eos> once all of the computers were setup i determined where i should put them. <eos> i really enjoy natural light so i settled on a nice place by a window.
the meeting began with check-in at 2pm. <eos> we started with a classroom session where we learned about the new program. <eos> we then saw a slideshow about the history of the company. <eos> we had some break time in the afternoon with snacks. <eos> followed by a q and a with each of the project managers.
beth has created an outreach program for families in need. <eos> with many sign ups she is slowly making a difference. <eos> the families have come to seek help and provide help if they can. <eos> many have come to speak on behalf of beth's help to the community. <eos> there is even presentations made on all the program has to offer for families. 
i went to the meeting last week. <eos> there were many people there. <eos> i had to give some presentations. <eos> afterward we had some dessert. <eos> there were many presentations there.
everyone gathered for the presentation. <eos> people took their seat and it began. <eos> the speakers made good points. <eos> afterwards, we had some food and talked. <eos> all in all it was a good day.
mary has to give a speech today. <eos> she is very nervous so she asks tom some questions. <eos> karen gets up first to prep the audience. <eos> after mary's speech, mark gets up to give his own. <eos> now it is elizabeth's turn to present her findings as well.
this area is full of beautiful architecture. <eos> it's great to get out to play in the water! <eos> more old buildings like this... <eos> ...and this, remind me of how beautiful they built things years ago. <eos> the vista is amazing!
school was out for the summer. <eos> the children spent some time in the lake. <eos> later we went on drive to a nearby town. <eos> we passed on of the world's oldest post office's  <eos> finally we reached the town. it was beautiful.
when i was on vacation last week the town was very small. <eos> the river was nearby. <eos> i went for a walk many times. <eos> i liked the building for the post office. <eos> i had a great time there.
we had a lot too that day and we got our first errand done quick. <eos> we went to the water and had some fun to begin the day. <eos> we then went to another place we needed to go. <eos> the post office was our final stop and we were glad to be done with everything. <eos> the day was really beautiful and we had time to have more fun.
our home town is quaint. <eos> we jumped in the river, <eos> and walked down the empty streets. <eos> visited the post office for some packages, <eos> and then enjoyed the view.
i just moved into town and i am looking for a house. this house looks nice, let's see how it looks inside. <eos> the kitchen is perfect! just the right size. not too big, not too small. <eos> the dining room is not my favorite color, but looks nice regardless of the color. i will probably repaint it. <eos> the living room is very nice. pretty simple, which is how i like it. <eos> the most important part of the house is the bathroom, to me. it looks marvelous! i think this is going to be the house for me!
we move into our new house tomorrow. <eos> the kitchen is small but functional. <eos> the dining room will be a great place to host parties. <eos> the living room is elegant. <eos> and the bedroom is gorgeous.
i love our new house. <eos> it is so beautiful. <eos> i love everything about it. <eos> i'm so happy we bought it. <eos> everything is great . 
the family was so excited to move into their new home. <eos> mom was excited about the spacious kitchen. <eos> the dining room had wonderful windows and was simply waiting for a dinner party. <eos> the living room was inviting and perfect for a house warming party. <eos> the bathroom was perfect for an evening of relaxing in the tub.
of all the houses we looked at yesterday, this is the one we liked the most. <eos> although the kitchen is small, it is big enough for our three family members. we especially liked the natural light it provides. <eos> the dining room contained bay windows and wooden floors. we were pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was. <eos> the living room was similar to the dining room, except for the beautiful chandelier that hung from the ceiling. <eos> the bedrooms were small, but roomy enough for us. there's 4 in total. that's plenty if we have a couple more kids!
the family arrived at the lodge for a day of fun. <eos> they went outside to see what animals they might see. they first saw a bald eagle. <eos> after awhile they came across a dear in the distance. <eos> they later took a walk and saw the beautiful mountains in the distance.  <eos> finally to complete they day they went on a helicopter tour. what a great day for the family!
our annual vacation to the lodge was a lot of fun. <eos> we saw so many birds while hiking through the woods. <eos> the deer were so used to people that they just posed for pictures. <eos> we hiked all the way to a canyon where we couldn't go farther. <eos> when we got back, we took a helicopter tour to see the rest.
i went to the nature sanctuary to see wildlife. <eos> i saw a bald eagle perched at the top of the tree. <eos> nearby, a male deer sat on the ground observing what was going on around him. <eos> the canyon in the park was absolutely gorgeous. <eos> finally, i saw a helicopter leaving on a search-and-rescue mission from the park.
they arrived at the lodge, then it was off to explore the flora and fauna. <eos> they saw a bald eagle, <eos> and a beautiful deer. <eos> the mountain scenery was so beautiful, <eos> they even went on a helicopter ride to get a bird's eye view of it all.
every summer we visit thr lodge.  <eos> we go bird watching.  <eos> we also practice animal tracking.  <eos> most of the time is spent just wondering around the grounds and adventuring  <eos> we almost always ebbs the our stay with a helicopter tour!
a group of coworkers decided they wanted to have a party. <eos> they bought some fancy wine glasses for the occasion,  <eos> and drank from those fancy wine glasses. <eos> they had lots of good food, <eos> and even some good entertainment.
everyone listening to the boss talk before they christmas party <eos> we even had a live sax player! <eos> everyone getting a little tipsy on champaign  <eos> always so serious <eos> we had a grand christmas party feast
a group of fans came together one day to celebrate the opening of a new studio for an artist. <eos> the artist provided champagne in flutes for everyone. <eos> friends toasted and cheered the artist as she opened her new studio. <eos> others ate from the buffet of hors d'oeuvres. <eos> everyone talked and had a great time with each other at the opening.
everyone had a good time at our family reunion. <eos> we even had a band. <eos> and i got to meet a lot of people. <eos> i even got to speak one-on-one with some of the family members. <eos> lest i forget, the food was amazing!
this is a speed dating meetup. <eos> here, the daters mingle during social hour with live musical entertainment. <eos> here is a close-up view of the daters chatting with each other with champagne flutes in their hands. <eos> here, two speed daters (not dating each other!) discuss their thoughts on the meetup.  <eos> this is a to-go table full of snacks for the speed daters to pick up on their way out, provided as a thank you for coming.
everyone came out for the art display <eos> there were so many different exhibits <eos> we were given a tour by the woman in charge <eos> her favorite were these collection of prints <eos> we all then had our picture taken outside as we stared at the beauty
everyone came to the conference last week. <eos> there were many slide presentations. <eos> i waited for the event to finish. <eos> when it was time to leave i packed my things. <eos> i said goodbye and left quickly.
managers attendance was required.  <eos> they would be introduced to the staff.  <eos> go over proper procedures.  <eos> they would be given the obligatory tour.  <eos> and finally, they would get a demonstration on the newly installed security system. 
before the start of the day, the team met to discuss upcoming goals. <eos> the president of the company gave a presentation. <eos> later, the group head out to put their new goals into practice. <eos> visitors from a collaborating company came to see what was new in the firm. <eos> a tour of the business was given to help welcome the newcomers on board.
there was an important meeting of office staff today. <eos> the receptionist worked alone in the office while the others were meeting. <eos> at one point they stepped outside to examine some helpful new technology. <eos> the reception area for visitors stood empty while the meeting progressed. <eos> after the meeting, they continued their discussions outside for some time before they finally called it a day.
my buddies and i went out for some sightseeing and nightlife. <eos> the golden lights were more soothing than neon party lights though. <eos> this chandelier that we came across was magnificent. <eos> we stopped for a bite to eat at the local fast food place. <eos> time to get this guy off of his phone and out to party.
met up with my friend at mc donalds and we are gonna go downtown. <eos> here's my friend. he's happy to see me. <eos> first stop, this building, it's a temple of some kind. <eos> then on to this building, it's really interesting. <eos> then off to the park where there are beautiful statues all around.
the friends have stopped for lunch in a food court. <eos> as they checked their phones another friend is taking their pictures. <eos> after lunch the friends went into town taking photos of various places they passed by. <eos> they continued on the walk seeing the city skyline. <eos> the friends made it to a park where they took a picture of this unique statue.
when i went on vacation last weekend i saw many huge buildings. <eos> the city was very beautiful at night. <eos> my hotel had a lovely lobby. <eos> i brought my friend with me. <eos> we had a great time there together.
tom and jerry are at the airport. <eos> they are waiting to board and want to get their food. <eos> they finally land and go straight to sight seeing. <eos> they explore the city, hoping to find something cool. <eos> they come across a fun little park with lots of sculptures, this is just what they wanted to see.
the men in the building were dressed formal. <eos> they were all talking at the conference. <eos> this man made a lot of funny remarks. <eos> he was our leader for the day in the office. <eos> our entire department took a picture after the training.
the guys at nasa are having a party.. <eos> they even brought some of their toys from home. <eos> they laughed and talked about space some. <eos> then they had a important meeting of the minds. <eos> after the meeting everyone was hungry and they had a nice little lunch
there was a conference meeting at work today. <eos> i took a lot of notes. <eos> i had to give a speech the whole time. <eos> afterward we had some time to chat together. <eos> we also took a group photo with everyone.
getting ready for the meeting.  <eos> trying to figure out what that is on the table. <eos> talking to a couple of friends <eos> in a meeting trying to figure out what is going on. <eos> having dinner with my co-workers.
our office at nasa is called the millenium falcon office. <eos> we have a model of the falcon, sort of a mascot for us. <eos> that shows something about the guys i work with. they don't take themselves overly seriously. <eos> we have a lot of meetings, but we also have a lot of laughs. <eos> we try to get together to have a meal at a restaurant at least once a month.
th screenwriter is writing a new story to be made into a movie. <eos> as he finishes up, he lists the cast members and gives them credit. <eos> his friend at work agrees to preview the movie and give his thoughts and ideas. <eos> he watches the movie on the screen all the way through to the end. <eos> he gives the screenwriter some ideas on things to change so that the movie will be a success.
at the office getting down to work for the day. <eos> the company needs to find a way to dispose of the broken towers an monitors. <eos> one co-worker giving the other worker a hand with the project. <eos> had to offer my friend a tic tic, i think he had onions on his hot dog. <eos> a young man waits for his interview as he hopes to be hired by the company.
while working i enjoy having sunlight coming through the windows. <eos> on my monitor i am working on the cast for a script. <eos> my coworker sometimes sits around and stares blankly at the wall. <eos> i love this location shown on my computer. what a great building. <eos> my coworker and i don't agree on the building.
an important deadline was approaching quickly, so our work group had to pull long hours to get the job done. <eos> we used our most advanced computing possible. <eos> things got a little heated after staying up so many hours. <eos> we didn't get to shower and brush our teeth, so these kept us from smelling too horribly. <eos> after hours of work, we were finally done! i enjoyed finally being able to relax and play a video game.
he is very happy to finally have modern office equipment.  <eos> the old computers were sitting in the corner awaiting pickup.  <eos> wouldn't you know the new computer would crash on the very first day.  <eos> time for a break.  <eos> meanwhile, not all the workers have desks. 
all set to travel the historic lighthouse path for this part of our vacation. <eos> and up the path we go. <eos> here we are at the historic lighthouse at the end of the path. <eos> this is the explanatory sign for the historic lighthouse and when it was built. <eos> here it is in all of it's glory. it's picture time, and part of a great vacation.
we came to this island for a vacation. <eos> there were many other tourists like us eating at this place. <eos> we drove on the roads in hopes of seeing some sights. <eos> we came upon this lighthouse close to the beach. <eos> we went up to the lighthouse to explore.
i went to see a historic lighthouse yesterday. <eos> it was a small lighthouse at the end of a point. <eos> it had a black base and a white top, near it was a mile marker to other locations. <eos> the plaque at the base told me when the lighthouse was in use. <eos> i got a really cool picture from right at the bottom, it looked great.
a map guides the way to the historic lighthouse. <eos> looking up at the lighthouse from below. <eos> the mile post sign showing various locations. <eos> a history lesson on the lighthouse. <eos> the view of the lighthouse from the ocean side.
samuel was a huge fan of lighthouses. he'd go see them wherever he want. <eos> he'd long had a dream to visit a remote lighthouse in england. <eos> when he got there, he was thrilled. he loved the signpost that pointed to other lighthouses around the world. <eos> he took a picture of the historic lighthouse plaque to add to his special album of such pictures. <eos> he took hundreds of pictures of the light itself, so he'd never forget the special day.
visited my family today for church services. <eos> this is my brother, joe, and my aunt sue. church was just getting over. <eos> two of my other uncles and me. <eos> had to stop by to see my cousin, han. he had to work today. <eos> jet and i went for a ride afterward.
going to church with my mom today. <eos> mom spends more time getting pictures of every single family member than anything else. <eos> oh look, a distant cousin, grab her before she sits down mom we don't have a picture of her yet! <eos> just when you think mom will walk away from the camera, nope, she grabs it back out of her purse and starts snapping pics of this group of people praying. <eos> well thank goodness that's over, 2 hours of pictures with distant relatives, we're finally free to go get some lunch...oh but look mom found uncle ren, the crazy man who still thinks he'll catch a germ if he takes off his medical mask. i cannot wait to get out of here!!
my whole family came to visit me in america today. <eos> my mom and dad showed up first. <eos> then my grandparents and cousin came to see me. <eos> my brother could care less, he just wanted to play on his computer. <eos> i took my dad out for a ride on my scooter while he was in town.
my family came into town. <eos> they went to church with me. <eos> they visited where i work at. <eos> they weren't too impressed by my office. <eos> but they did enjoy my scooter.
the whole family poses during the reunion. <eos> harry and maude smile for the camera! <eos> the siblings are happy to be together again. <eos> john works at his computer. <eos> jenny and john went on a motorcycle ride.
it was time to venture on a journey <eos> off to bear lane they went <eos> they had to stop and refuel at the station <eos> they visited the fire station <eos> and met all the brave fire fighters 
i had to find the fire department. <eos> there was a fire nearby that i needed to warn them about. <eos> i finally found the building after searching for hours. <eos> i had to run around to the front. <eos> i saw the sign.
the fire department is located in bear lane. <eos> the class went on a field trip, <eos> to learn about the techniques used, <eos> and the many ways, <eos> the fire department protects the community.
we were on bear lane. <eos> this board advertised a business. <eos> we got to see a fire station along the way. <eos> the walls were covered with bricks. <eos> it was the warwickshire fire and rescue service.
i was born in warwickshire, a small town in england, and i love to go back to visit. <eos> my childhood home was on bear lane. <eos> my father was a fireman, so i go to visit the fire crew when i'm there. <eos> they are always glad to see me. <eos> i feel like i'm back in my childhood years when i'm there!
before we toured the new space, we were able to examine some plans so the layout was not a total surprise. <eos> as soon as we entered the building we noticed the old details had been preserved. <eos> the large windows allowed lots of light to enter the large rooms. <eos> the wood details in the old walls had also been preserved. <eos> the kitchen although serviceable, could use some updating if we were to sign the lease.
visiting and moving into new apartment.  <eos> checking out the kitchen.  <eos> new bedroom backslash made out of bricks.  <eos> cool square lighting in the living room. <eos> fire escape plans, and emergency exit. 
my friend decided to show off his new warehouse office to me one day. <eos> the office was an open plan, but had a kitchen worked in to the former warehouse space. <eos> his future office had the brick wall of the building as a feature wall. <eos> the ceiling had interesting light fixtures installed. <eos> the floor plan showed where his office was in relation to all the others. 
today was the move in day for the college student who was moving into his first apartment alone. <eos> he was very excited about planning out where he was going to move all his furniture. <eos> this wall will be sturdy enough to hang his new television.  <eos> the lighting is unique and will help save money versus using his old lamps.  <eos> he also made sure to take note of the fire escape plan for the future. he was prepared for anything and excited to finally move in.
the house i bought required a lot of renovations. i ordered the original house plans to help me decide what to do. <eos> i started with the wooden trim in the living room. <eos> then i did a many-paned window in the bedroom. <eos> the cellar used to have very cool wooden columns on bricks, and i restored them. <eos> i painted the kitchen the shade of pewter blue it was years ago. i love the way the house is working out!
my wife was so happy to bring our daughter. <eos> there were other people there to watch the performance. <eos> the men were protesting outside. <eos> behind the scenes were clever students. <eos> there was a team of students who created the performance.
today we picked to get a new healthcare for our state. alot of people showed up. <eos> this room was filled to capacity. <eos> these are some who attended the meeting. <eos> this is joe, he was fully into this. <eos> large crowds for health care.
lorraine was enthused to attend her daughter's ballet recital. <eos> the rest of the crowd began to hush as the performance began. <eos> when we left we saw two nice men holding a sign. <eos> in our garage, jane began to program.  <eos> mark checked her programming before he left our garage. 
protest going on outside for equality health care. <eos> having a school meeting on health care. <eos> everyone learning about health care! <eos> oh look its me one of my friends grabbed the camera. <eos> everyone educated on health care finally!
a group of protesters for social inequality are protesting outside. <eos> we went inside to watch an assembly. <eos> we are killing time before the main event. <eos> he's really happy taking a break. <eos> we are still watching the assembly.
our company was having a big planning meeting. <eos> it seemed as though everyone was there. <eos> lots of presentations took place. <eos> and big plans were put into place. <eos> afterwards we all talked and enjoyed each others company.
tim arrive for his first day of college. <eos> he entered the class room and got to learning. <eos> the teacher then asked him to get up in front of the class and solve a problem on the board. <eos> next he was shown a presentation about business. <eos> he was really absorbing so much information on just his first day.
there were a lot of people at the school today. <eos> all of the students showed up to class. <eos> the instructor was very impressed. <eos> we had a final next week. <eos> after class we stayed to chat.
they parked and got ready to be bored out of their minds. <eos> the lecture ended up being interesting. <eos> someone had to get a replacement marker for the dry erase board. <eos> a man's stomach was growling so loudly everyone could hear it. <eos> they wished it was cat videos instead of powerpoint.
i just started working for a new company. <eos> sometimes i feel like i do nothing but attend meetings. <eos> yesterday's meeting was followed by a post-meeting, meeting. <eos> i do have to admit that i am learning a lot during these get-togethers. <eos> but still, i hope that i can start doing some real work in a matter of weeks.
the truck was orange and rusted. <eos> the tires were in a close jumble. <eos> the bus was broken down and rusted. <eos> the bus was well prepared and old. <eos> inside, i could see the interior.
decided to explore at an abandoned junkyard today. lots of wrecked cars and vans and trucks, everywhere. <eos> not to mention the hundreds of tires. <eos> think this is just some broken down junk? <eos> nope. apparently, someone lives here. <eos> the warehouse was oddly beautiful. we'll explore it more deeply the next time we come out.
i had never actually been to a junk yard before. <eos> look at all of these tires! <eos> somehow i just felt this could make a really great picture for a wall, maybe the office. <eos> this bus had definitely seen it's better days. <eos> notice anything different about it?
we walked through the junk yard. <eos> tires where everywhere in there. <eos> most of the vehicles there where pretty messed up. <eos> some where in better condition then others. <eos> we got to take a look inside of a few.
an old white bus sank into a junkyard ground. <eos> many rows of old tires were stored in a dirty room. <eos> there was an old silver rv that looked like it needed some cleaning up. <eos> there was a cluttered room that appeared to be the junkyard office. <eos> a man basked in a beam of light coming in from a hole in a ceiling.
there was once a breaking news story that happened at this exact location.  <eos> so the news truck rolled up and started setting up. <eos> and the reporter showed up to start filming. <eos> soon a whole crowd gathered around to see what was happening. <eos> so they were incorporated into the news story.
last night i saw someone break into a van. <eos> they drove off with it as i called the police. <eos> the news crew came to report on it. <eos> the whole area was lit up. <eos> a crowd of people stopped to watch.
i've always liked the city part at night. the lights by the trees make a cool scene. <eos> even regular trees look a little spooky in the dark. <eos> my friend joe and i hang out at midnight in the park a lot. <eos> sometimes, we do secret planting projects to surprise people. <eos> one time, i got a whole gang together and we planted a lot of flowers.
it is nighttime in the city. <eos> the van parks by the fence. <eos> people begin to get out of the van. <eos> two people set up a camera. <eos> a huge group of people poses for a picture.
we don't get a lot for snow in our area, but we were amazed to see the tv truck pull up outside of work.  <eos> it appeared that they had selected our parking lot to do their live feed from.  <eos> the newscaster got out and they did the shot, broadcasting live as we all watched.  <eos> she was very nice and suggested that we line up behind her for when they came back from commercial.  <eos> so we did, and she asked us each what we thought of the snow on the air. it was pretty cool. 
i love the view from my office.  <eos> so often when i look out the window, there are birds. <eos> this little guy was perched here fro quite awhile this morning. <eos> this one stopped by only for a few minutes. <eos> this afternoon i was able to watch this one for awhile. being i love birds, it's no wonder i love my view.
birds have a very social life <eos> this bird is looking for a friend <eos> but isn't having much luck today <eos> but just as he was about to give up... <eos> another bird flew over 
i saw the bird as soon as i walked in and froze. <eos> i didn't know if i should photograph it quietly or shoo it away thru and open window. <eos> i was enamored by the lighting upon the bird. <eos> i tried to photograph it, but of course it moved around when it recognized that i was there. <eos> i ended up getting an okay photo, just not the one i wanted.
i went down to the pier last week. <eos> there were a lot of birds out there. <eos> i took many pictures of them. <eos> they were relaxing at the pier. <eos> there were many different kinds.
everyday in my office a black and yellow bird comes to visit me.  <eos> here he is now.  <eos> i love seeing him. i wave to him and he waves back.  <eos> he always sings me a song. it brightens my day.  <eos> then this guys comes and my black and yellow bird flys away. until tomorrow, my friend. 
i've decided to collect old magazine ads and articles, also perhaps photos. <eos> this is a photo of what appears to be a medical facility. <eos> old dental ads are great. <eos> volt ohm tubes seem like something from an old monster movie, and might be. <eos> an old ad from a college for souvenir spoons tends to make one giggle a bit.
i looked through the manual. <eos> there was nothing in there. <eos> not what i was looking for. <eos> just page after page. <eos> it was useless.
this is a flyer of where we're going this weekend. <eos> it's an old building offering different things from the 1800's. <eos> will be totally awesome to see this. i love it. <eos> some of these things, i have never heard of. <eos> the place is called the plexus office.
the main lobby where you wait. <eos> this is what the operating room used to look like. <eos> he is a famous doctor. <eos> here is a picture of different things. <eos> making a doctor's visit more comfortable. 
a vintage advertisement for a clinical school. <eos> there were nurses training in an open room. <eos> there was a vintage advertisement for dental chairs. <eos> there were also advertisements for contraptions like static machines. <eos> there was a souvenir spoon available fir $1.75.
our business class area has ample room to relax while waiting for your plane to depart.  <eos> we even offer reclining chairs for lay-overs.  <eos> inside the plane you can relax in or spacious chairs. <eos> each chair has a pillow that is hypoallergenic as well as soft. <eos> for those times your business requires a computer, we offer areas for your needs. 
amy had a business trip planned and headed for the airport <eos> the airplane was comfortable and she had a nice ride <eos> finally she landed right at dawn. <eos> she waited for someone to pick her up for the meeting.  <eos> then boarded the a plane home later that evening
i waited at the airport for my flight. <eos> there were a lot of comfortable seats there. <eos> i got to ride in first class. <eos> the chairs were very comfortable. <eos> i had a great time on the flight.
this is the hotel lobby that we stayed at. <eos> here is where i sat on my private plane ride. <eos> look at the sunset. <eos> another shot of the lobby from the other side. <eos> here are what all the seats look like on the plane.
we left the hotel for out plane. <eos> the plane was really nice inside. <eos> we took off around evening. <eos> it sucked leaving that nice airport. <eos> but the flight was well worth it.
our sports teams showed great spirit this week. <eos> they always play fair and friendly. <eos> the guys team is fast and furious as always. <eos> they like to pull surprise moves on their opponents. <eos> the cheerleaders keep the spirit alive for us all.
the basketball game was very exciting. <eos> there were many good players there. <eos> i had a great time watching. <eos> it was a very close game. <eos> i'm very glad that i went.
here are our basketball tryouts for 2015 girls and boys basketball. <eos> these are some great players this year. they are gonna work hard to earn a trophy. <eos> here are the guys and they are every bit good and hyper to play. <eos> look at those moves. the skills on these guys will prove we will prevail both boys and girls. <eos> here are the cheerleaders cheering them on in there free time.
two players from rival schools were plating a basketball game. <eos> one woman tried to block another womans pass. <eos> there were also mens basketball games happening. <eos> two men raced for the ball. <eos> cheerleaders cheered the team on. 
our basketball team has been a lot better since we added a good center. <eos> her sister still plays for another team, so it was hard to get her to leave. <eos> having a center opens up three point shots for our best shooters. <eos> it also helps attract other good players like our new point guard. <eos> i think our team will only get better as the year goes on.
winter was very severe this year. <eos> everything was covered with snow. <eos> it took hours to get the road cleared. <eos> i had to help out as well. <eos> by the end of the day it snowed again.
it was a snowy day in the city. <eos> the snow filled up much of all the parks in the city. <eos> the roads were very dangerous to be on but business had to go on. <eos> these volunteers helped shovel some snow of the roads. <eos> this family trying to cross the road in all the snow.
the calm before the snow storm comes into town. <eos> over night it slowed a lot enough to blanket everything in sight with snow. <eos> surprisingly the city streets have remained open to traffic. <eos> this local business owner is shoveling the snow away from the sidewalk near hos business. <eos> the show has tarted again and is starting to make driving difficult.
it is a picture of roof tops. <eos> the ground and fence is covered in snow. <eos> the street is covered in snow. <eos> a man is shoveling snow. <eos> people walking in the snow.
we went on the rooftop <eos> to see the city on this snowy day. <eos> walking down town to get our errands done,  <eos> we saw many people in their day to day lives. <eos> walking is good for people watching.
i just bought a new bike for my bicycle collection. <eos> this bike is really old and expensive. <eos> this one is a rare edition. <eos> everything still works. <eos> there is some slight wear but i'm going to fix it up a little.
i fix old bikes for a living. <eos> i specialize in special editions. <eos> this brand is one of my favorites. <eos> the seat is perfectly contoured. <eos> and the gears are well made.
my father pulled his old bicycle out of storage for me to ride. <eos> we saw that the bicycle had been made in the early 1980s. <eos> the bicycle was a 10th anniversary edition for the manufacturer. <eos> the gears looked as though they needed a little cleaning, but otherwise were in good shape. <eos> the frame of the bicycle was in perfect condition and was ready to be ridden.
this is my racing bike. i have been in many races with my wonderful bike. <eos> it is a 10th anniversary edition life cycle. it is also in my favorite color, black and gold <eos> i had just won my my first race. thank you life cycle for not giving up on me <eos> my poor seat has taking a beating, but it is so comfortable! <eos> i will be replacing the chain. as you can see it has been worn down already.
the bike is at a bike shop. <eos> it is an older bike and needs work. <eos> each part is striped and fixed the way it needs to be. <eos> the gears need to be oiled. <eos> finally the bar on it needs a touch up.
the cheerleaders warmed up the crowd. <eos> todd dribbled the ball towards the net. <eos> he scored a basket for his team. <eos> tom took the ball from todd. <eos> it was his turn to score a goal.
the local high school is very big on sports <eos> the cheerleaders are the best around.  <eos> the basketball team was #1 last year. <eos> jeff johnson is all county in basketball.  <eos> he is always a team player
i went down to the gym yesterday. <eos> they were having a basketball game. <eos> the game was very close. <eos> all of the players were very good. <eos> i had a great time at the gym.
they finished their performance for the crowd. <eos> the basketball player was pumped up after the performance. <eos> this man jumped high into the air. <eos> this player prepared his next shot. <eos> the team in white dominated the team in yellow.
the cheerleaders got everyone hyped for the game. <eos> it was a tough competition, and everyone was good. <eos> but some athletes emerged as elite. <eos> they were clearly proud of their talent. <eos> though everyone had fun, only half of them would be winners.
some of the new equipment came today.  <eos> now we can set up and organize the office. <eos> we like to check out the electronics first. <eos> some people are no help setting things up. <eos> there, all finished; clean, cozy and comfortable.
we moved offices earlier this week. <eos> so much work to do. here are some of the most used tools. <eos> wires, wires, everywhere. <eos> i sure do like the view though. <eos> putting together bookshelves is always a good time.
this is the first package to arrive at my new office. i'm very excited about this opportunity! <eos> in the box i found all of my promotional material. this will definitely boost business! <eos> here i am going over the business plan with my partner. don't we look deep in thought? <eos> this is our desk. we're starting to get really organized.  <eos> this is the waiting area for the clients. i think we may put a coffee maker in soon. i love my new office!
i finally got all the parts for my desk. <eos> i had to put them all together. <eos> it took me forever to untangle all the wire. <eos> there were a lot of pieces. <eos> it took us all day long
packing things to get ready to move. <eos> here are my books are wrapped up. <eos> my friend and i looking at stuff on the internet. <eos> hard at work making sure everything goes right. <eos> loving the new couch in the office, nice way to relax.
john and judy were ready for the march. <eos> they had stayed in a nice hotel. <eos> the next day there were many people gathered.  <eos> they all wanted a change. <eos> the guards tried to their best to protect the crowds and keep the peace. 
they came to support their cause... <eos> however, the capitol building was empty... <eos> there wasn't a sole on the steps... <eos> until they arrived at the park. <eos> everyone there cheered and awaited to be told it was okay.
i went down to the rally yesterday. <eos> it was right outside the courthouse. <eos> everyone was there. <eos> we were all standing up for our rights. <eos> the white house was nearby.
this is a picture of two people. <eos> this is a picture of the capitol building. <eos> this is a picture of a building. <eos> this is a picture of a crowd. <eos> this is a picture of a group.
samuel and jeff pose at the congressman's office. <eos> the capitol building seemed to gleam in the sunlight. <eos> the steps to the congress were intimidating! <eos> there was a small demonstration that day. <eos> i think there were about a hundred people gathered outside'
the day began with a lot of hard work from the control room. <eos> the leaders ensured that nothing would go wrong. <eos> speeches were made to commemorate the occasion. <eos> the rope was ceremoniously cut! <eos> afterwards, the group posed for a picture.
there was to be a press conference today at the security building. <eos> the guards had to make sure everything was right for the speech. <eos> they had to make sure that everything was working properly. <eos> everything was working right and it was time for the speech. <eos> the speech was given by the chairmen of the board.
today my team and i ran the control room of the mayer's ribbon cutting ceremony. <eos> we used dozens of screens. <eos> i made sure the mayer was safe during his speech. <eos> and i watched as he safely cut the ribbon. <eos> my team did an excellent job keeping everyone safe and monitoring the event today.
our company has a central monitoring system, where all employees are monitored at all times. <eos> we have an eye on every one of our fifty-three offices. <eos> the head of monitoring knows that good monitoring makes for good workers. <eos> the whole monitoring crew has gotten extensive training. <eos> we feel they are the backbone of our success.
today was the big day to receive certification. <eos> they had trained hard for months. <eos> david said he'd never seen so many qualified people in one room. <eos> sandra wished she hadn't worn the red jacket. <eos> they posed for a photo and soaked in the glory of accomplishment.
at the tech conference, a woman gave a great presentation on cyber secuirt. <eos> people were really interested. <eos> another woman gave a presentation on international hacking threats. <eos> people took lots of notes. <eos> but most people were still in their hotel rooms, asleep.
there was a great turnout for the lecture. <eos> everyone was at attention waiting for the speaker. <eos> she was very knowledgeable and spoke well. <eos> she had everyone on the edge of their seats. <eos> many people took notes to remember her facts.
everyone went into the meeting room. <eos> once everyone was seated, the talking began. <eos> people at the front said their piece. <eos> the people in the crowd took noted on it. <eos> the meeting lasted a few hours, then ended.
the speaker begins on her speech of how to help california with their draught. <eos> important people listen to the speaker on how to solve the problem. <eos> one way the speakers says is to levy a fine on people who water their lawn. <eos> everyone agrees this is one way to curb water usage. <eos> more than half the important people don't think there is a water shortage.
the day of the education conference had arrived and as soon as the doors open people began to mill into seats. <eos> many conference goers waited patiently for the first round of speakers to take the stand. <eos> each speaker was given a certain amount of time to go over the specifics of what they were trying to say. <eos> the audience members listened closely as they took down notes or nodded in agreement. <eos> other attendees preferred to take notes the old fashioned way; with a pen and a notebook. 
the countdown for the start of the meeting began. <eos> ceo quan stepped out with much fanfare. <eos> he introduced the paper thin tv. <eos> he also talked about the automatic robot vacuum. <eos> then he told about japans foray into wearable tech.
i got tickets to the game last week. <eos> it was really intense. <eos> the scores were very close all game long. <eos> both teams wanted to win badly. <eos> it was a struggle for both of them.
the hockey game was intense. <eos> the goalie had given up many goals. <eos> the panthers fought back. <eos> they tried to defend the capitals. <eos> but the capitals kept on shooting.
he prepped himself before passing the puck  <eos> the pass was good and he made a powerful shot <eos> he then was slammed against the glass in front of the opposing team <eos> the puck was now in the red teams possession  <eos> he was all alone with his puck
my favorite hockey team has always been the washington capitols. <eos> i love seeing the capitols's opponents keeled over in disappointment.  <eos> i'm not a fan of fighting, but if you mess with players on the capitols you will get what you deserve. <eos> my favorite player to watch with the puck is alex ovechkin. <eos> ovechkin is an expert goal scorer and not a bad passer.
does this monkey suit make me look fat? <eos> fun dressing up together. wearing baboon suit. <eos> do i scare you yet? <eos> look! i'm hairy like a monkey! <eos> monkeys can do creepy stuff.
for the office halloween party a man's wife brought him a gorilla suit. <eos> the man started changing into the suit by first putting on the mask. <eos> after he put on the mask he started to take off his shirt to put on the rest of the suit. <eos> he put on the rest of the suit, but in order to get it on he had to take off the mask. <eos> after he got the full suit on he jumped out from behind his cubical to the surprise of the rest of the office.
everyone at the office wanted to try on the gorilla outfit.  <eos> it went from one worker to the next.  <eos> one worker didn't need the suit as he is as hairy as a gorilla himself.  <eos> we did get our work done, though.  <eos> then returned to running on our knuckles and eating bananas. 
it's prank day at work, susan seems ready. <eos> dan tries on the gorilla costume for later. <eos> mike works for bananas. <eos> some of us don't need to wear the full costume. <eos> fez wearing gorilla finally makes his dancing debut.
the gorilla suit looks realistic. <eos> alex wanted to try it on. <eos> but he took the mask. <eos> and he didn't need the rest of the costume. <eos> the gorilla suit makes us crazy.
my life is dull. <eos> i take photos of my breakfast. <eos> i also take photos of empty plates. <eos> this is my computer. <eos> there was a crack in the drywall. 
i sat down to eat at the desk so i can get my work done. <eos> some time had passed before i started getting hungry again. <eos> so i thought i would borrow a bike from downstairs to leave and get some food. <eos> i returned it to it's position when i got back. <eos> and sat down at the table to have my meal.
i sat down today to document my life. <eos> first, i ate a nice meal in the cafeteria. <eos> the remains of the meal on my plate were tossed away. <eos> then i returned to work at my computer, which is very old. <eos> finally, i accidentally punched a hole in the wall when i turned too quickly.
a quick view of our home shows our computer from the top. <eos> we are in the middle of eating our meal. <eos> this is my husband's plate. <eos> this is our computer from the front. <eos> it looks like we need our wall patched up.
the computer desk was organized <eos> so the person cooked a meal <eos> and ate all of it. <eos> then they went back to work <eos> and they noticed a hole in the wall.
my husband was very prepared for breakfast. <eos> he brought a tree to the office in spirit. <eos> when it was almost time to go, we looked at the clock. <eos> when he got home, he watered the grass with no socks on. <eos> we made gingerbread cookies together.
he got an early start. <eos> he met his friends for breakfast. <eos> then it was time for work at the office. <eos> he ate dinner out. <eos> then he drove around looking at christmas light displays.
my co-worker ted helped us get ready for a christmas party. <eos> he decorated the tree in the office. <eos> at 10 minutes to 5, we decided to stop working for the day. <eos> ted went outside in his bare feet to water the grass. <eos> when he came back in, we had a bunch of gingerbread cookies out to enjoy.
we helped ourselves to food to start the day. <eos> a christmas tree is displayed in the office. <eos> it is almost time to leave the office. <eos> later, we hose the grass to make sure it gets fed. <eos> lastly, we made gingerbread cookies for a treat.
the guy was getting a meal <eos> and then saw the christmas tree <eos> near the clock. <eos> after he went home he used the hose <eos> before making some cookies.
it was spring in the united states and the weather was cloudy and overcast.  <eos> a completely random snow storm hit without warning in the midwest.  <eos> the trees with their new growth were covered in snow.  <eos> small flowers that had just bloomed were frozen and most died.  <eos> even the cat tails fell victim and took weeks to recover. 
it was an odd day to have such a large snowfall in may, but made for a great day to take pictures. <eos> the spring flowers were peaking through the icy snow. <eos> hopefully the last frost doesn't damage the seeds for next year, but these crab apples look strong enough.  <eos> the pansies were tough enough to withstand the snow on their petals. <eos> what an amazing, quiet, snowy morning. 
today, we had no school because of the snow. <eos> it was such a great day. <eos> i went around to look at all the things covered in snow. <eos> it was early, so no one else was up. <eos> soon, my friends arrived and we could play in the snow.
it was a cold day at the historic university. <eos> there had been a blizzard the previous night and everything was covered in snow. <eos> the beautiful trees still had little red flowers blooming out. it was a gorgeous winter day. <eos> there were many beautiful flowers such as tulips throughout the school. everything was covered in a soft white blanket of snow. <eos> the day was a cold and brisk, but it was such a beautiful sight to see. 
the snow made the building pretty <eos> but covered the live plants <eos> and the berries. <eos> the flowers were hidden  <eos> but the scenery was very nice.
the boardwalk hadn't had a customer in weeks. <eos> the carousel was deserted. <eos> they enlisted the help of the cameras to find the people. <eos> they went to the local mall to drum up business. <eos> ultimately they discovered that everyone was trapped in the maze.
we stopped at a carnival on the way to the vacation house  <eos> when we got there i took this photo of the front  <eos> here we all are heading to check in  <eos> after check in we walked up the steps to our room  <eos> i took this photo after dinner the first night 
the group of friends took a trip in june and started at an amusement park.  <eos> they enjoyed riding the merry-go-round.  <eos> some of the students were amused by the camera lens on top of a building next to the merry-go-round.  <eos> after they went to the amusement park, the group traveled to a local museum.  <eos> the students ended the trip when they saw some unusual gardens. 
going site seeing. the carnival is a great place to start, with all the colors and rides <eos> here at the merry go round, all the colors are bright and beautiful. a great site to see. <eos> here is more common sight. the camera is watching us. <eos> here, we all got together to discuss the sites we've seen, and continue with our trip. <eos> now, it's the end of the day. a compilation of great architecture and landscaping. a beautiful scene.
the wheel was tall <eos> and had a big ferris wheel. <eos> there was a light <eos> and the people were filming <eos> near the garden.
there once was an artist who loved to work with food to create surrealist art. <eos> his work was admired by all of his peers, and one day his good friend encouraged him to open a gallery. <eos> so the artist got all of his best work, of which his favorite was death by dairy product. <eos> his second favorite piece was also on display showing the effects of overcooking. <eos> on the night of the gallery opening it seems that the crowd favorite; however, seemed to be the video piece on food consumption.
museum display of a block of butter, knife, and jelly at the massachusetts college of art and design.  <eos> close up picture of the artwork.  <eos> setting up second exhibition.  <eos> exhibition three, basket of lobster name the crown.  <eos> closeup realistic of two lobsters and claws. 
block of bloody cheese anyone? just kidding but this is a rel work of art. <eos> today i went to help my friend prepare for his art show and this is what i arrived to. i knew right away this would be interesting. <eos> the part i helped with was placing yellow sticky notes under a piece of plastic. <eos> there were 2 interesting art pieces this is the first one. <eos> this is the second a sort of lobster bird.all was as interesting as was thought to be.
it took a long time for me but i eventually finished making my cake. <eos> i put it up on a pedestal for everyone to see the work that i did. <eos> i made a huge mess when trying to transport it. <eos> there were some other things that other people put up on their pedestals but i think my cake was better. <eos> some people put up a bunch of garbage.
phil worked very hard for years on his art. <eos> it was the night of his first gallery show. <eos> one of his pieces of art was cheese with blood flowing from it. <eos> he also made art that wasn't cheese based. <eos> the gallery opened and people came in to judge the art.
these beekeepers are busily working there hives. <eos> they are checking the progress of the bees today making delicious honey. <eos> this beekeeper shows us one of the honeycombs the bees are filling up. <eos> the bees donã¢â‚¬â„¢t pay us any mind as they go about their work. <eos> they come back periodically to deposit their nectar.
this is my first time as a bee catcher <eos> i worked intently to get them inside the homemade hives  <eos> i had to be very careful as to not get stung  <eos> look at all those queen bees  <eos> we had succeeded and then started another hive
the beekeepers all gathered around the bees. <eos> they took them out of their hive. <eos> the bees all clung to the honeycomb sheets. <eos> there were so many of them! <eos> some bees flew away but the beekeepers did not worry because they knew they would always come back home.
don is a bee keeper. <eos> he collected 5000 bees with his two sons. <eos> they have a thriving honey operation. <eos> their bees produce top quality honey. <eos> they have their bee keeper friends over often to keep bees.
the bee team was hard at work today. <eos> steven caught a whole tray of bees. <eos> there must have been thousands of them. <eos> they produced a lot of honey. <eos> some of the bees tried to run away from the ranch. 
the three saw the most attractive balls they had ever seen. <eos> brandon decided to demonstrate his strength using the orange ball. <eos> sarah was holding the balls like she owned them, but eventually offered to share them with jen.  <eos> jen refused to give the balls back. <eos> sarah was mad that jen stole the balls and attacked jen. 
the girls haven't seen each other in a few months <eos> so they went to the park <eos> it was a fun day <eos> they played lawn bowling <eos> and compared muscles with each other
we went to the park together to play. <eos> tom was very good at throwing the balls a far distance. <eos> jane just posed with them. <eos> ellen held on to them before her turn to throw them. <eos> then we decided to sit down for a picnic.
these girls are looking forward to a day the park. <eos> stretched out in the sunshine for little relaxation, well deserved. <eos> the girls engage in a little wrestling match, all in good fun. <eos> she does a little stretching to loosen up. <eos> the girls compare biceps to see who has the bigger muscles.
the group of friends decided to go out on a hot day. they wanted to work out at the local park. <eos> both of the girls were fans of working out. they decided to have a picnic at a nearby park as well. <eos> the friends had a lot of fun working out. they also got to spend some intimate time together. <eos> the practiced various stretching exercising and yoga. it was relaxing and fun. <eos> at the end of the day the exercises really gave them a good workout. it was a fun and productive day.
i was off work this weekend so i decided to attend the local car show. <eos> there was a huge variety of cars. <eos> i was able to check under the hood with this one. <eos> i fell in love with this one. <eos> i would love the chance to drive this car, but i know it won't happen. i'm just happy that i was able to attend the car show.
there were many cans of gasoline stored. <eos> these two men wore very interesting shirts. <eos> we decided to observe the televisions. <eos> the orange car arrived in excellent condition.  <eos> together, we made the plane for the next event.
we went to an auto show today. <eos> we saw many amazing cars. <eos> we saw cars that had hoods that went up in a weird way. <eos> we even saw many race cars. <eos> we saw cars that were old and antique as well.
being in the pit at a race is exciting. <eos> the guys got a couple of official shirts from the race team. <eos> we got to watch a movie about the sport. <eos> the cars were so pretty! <eos> it was nice hanging out with the officials.
at the car expo, there were a number of different vendors, each with their own make and model to display. <eos> one of the cars, an orange muscle car seemed notable especially because of the design of the bumper. <eos> other cars were designed off of classic roadsters, but were modern in the design and technological implementation.  <eos> towards the back of the expo floor there was even a race car, complete with some of the items from the pit. <eos> another race car was notable because of the 70s like design that covered it. 
in the day time, there weren't many cars on the road.  <eos> we used the bridge to get closer to our home.  <eos> when we got home, we noticed the room was barren and dry. <eos> the buildings were very tall in comparison to me. <eos> inside the buildings was cluttered and dimly lit.
when we arrived at the small town, we were ready to explore and enjoy the sights. <eos> so many old and interesting buildings, we just didnã¢â‚¬â„¢t know where to start. <eos> i wonder whatã¢â‚¬â„¢s down this street? i hope lots of little shops, since i love to shop. <eos> we found this old church, i bet itã¢â‚¬â„¢s been here for hundreds of years. <eos> such a beautiful day and iã¢â‚¬â„¢m enjoying so much, all the sights to see.
we drove our car to the city. <eos> the bridge was a long ride. <eos> the roof was very well made. <eos> this monument was the grandest i have ever seen. <eos> we finally got there.
this is a picture of a road. <eos> this is a picture of a bridge. <eos> this is a picture of a building. <eos> this is a picture of a sunny day. <eos> this is a picture of a dark room.
the street only had a few people on it. <eos> a bridge sat in silence as i crossed it. <eos> some of the roofing looked very old. <eos> the church sat nicely against the blue sky. <eos> i slept very well after touring the city. 
the donkey woke up early to drink water. <eos> most of my family members visited my farm on that day. <eos> my dad even came to pet my donkey. <eos> we formed a long line and walked in circles. <eos> the donkey appeared to have a great time.
many people showed up at the ranch today. <eos> everyone was very excited to see the donkeys. <eos> after everyone got there, many people walked the donkeys together. <eos> grandma even got her picture taken with one of the donkeys. <eos> grandpa got to walk a donkey outside before we left.
during the summer, the family decided to visit our family in texas. <eos> we visited some relatives who live on a ranch.  <eos> our relatives nourish donkeys who are ill. <eos> we took a few pictures of our relatives checking the animals. they do this weekly to make sure the donkeys are in good health. <eos> at the end of the day, we met a donkey that was more than 10 years old.

at the annual stone soup festival, everyone brings ingredients to add to the stone soup. <eos> this man brings sprouts, a source of vitamin c. <eos> this couple brought vegetables fresh from their garden. <eos> these ladies found a golden ticket, which gave them free admission to stone soup. <eos> these kids share their stone soup from a big orange bowl.
we arrived at the festival looking forward to an enjoyable day. <eos> this man had an interesting display of grass for the lawn. <eos> george wanted to be sure and enter the contest, maybe he will get lucky. <eos> these ladies wanted to show the programs they signed up for a good cause. <eos> paul and jane picked up some plants that will go nicely in their yard.

we went sailing last weekend <eos> we the boys. <eos> it was peaceful on the lake. <eos> we enjoyed our hotdogs made below deck <eos> and partied all through the night.
the weather didn't look great at first for my annual boating trip with my brothers. <eos> however, nothing stops us! <eos> it cleared up pretty quickly, and we took off. <eos> larry did the cooking for supper. yep, hot dogs again! <eos> we love eating on the boat and being together. it's a great time.

mary introduced the twins to their new daddy. <eos> then the boys played cornhole. <eos> a tattoo artist was on hand, plying his wares. <eos> mom is going to love sarah's new tattoo! <eos> music was provided by placing a goose in a bag and squeezing it repeatedly. what do they wear under their kilts, anyway?
this was the twins very first family reunion. they enjoyed being greeted by different family members. <eos> life can become so busy that families tend to lose touch, so there was a lot of catching up to do as we sat around the pick-nick table and talked. <eos> other relatives enjoyed playing games. (the males in our family can be so competitive.) <eos> many of the cousins hadn't seen each other in years and wanted pictures to remember the time that they spent together. <eos> the reunion was a big success, everyone was happy and there were lots of smiles.
we have a large family reunion every few years. this was the girl's first time. <eos> the adults had fun playing in the yard. <eos> we even hired a face painter. <eos> he painted anyone's face as long as they wanted it. <eos> at the end, one of the richer relatives hired a bagpipe player. not everyone was pleased by that choice of entertainment.
this is a picture of babies. <eos> this is a picture of golf. <eos> this is a picture of two people. <eos> this is a picture of face paint. <eos> this is a picture of a man.
i took the twins to marine corps day for the first time this year. <eos> there's always a lot of fun things going on there.  <eos> this father was coaching his daughter before it was her turn at the bean bag toss. <eos> this woman got facepainted, although i think it was mostly for the kids. <eos> the bagpiper always ends the day.
this man was making a spear using traditional methods. <eos> this woman was about to weave a basket out of reeds. <eos> this is what her basket is going to look like when she finishes. <eos> the locals grabbed all of the visitors and asked them to dance with them. <eos> this man is crafting some jewelry out of animal bones.
"jim aims his blowgun. <eos> mom warns, ""be careful with that, or someone might lose an eye!"" <eos> jack ducks, so he doesn't lose an eye to the blowgun's projectile. <eos> the projectile narrowly misses sam. jack looks on and laughs. <eos> "this lady has a growth on her back.
the local native american tribe had a festival and the had a bon fire. <eos> the women showed everyone how to make things out of feathers. <eos> the showed people how to make baskets. <eos> they then had a dance and everyone joined in. <eos> the last thing they did was show us how to make arrow heads.
the festival of native arts was wonderful. first, we learned how to make a fire. <eos> next, there was a weaving demonstration. it was fascinating.  <eos> the basket that got woven was raffled off later in the day. <eos> the dancing lesson got all of us laughing! <eos> we loved the show of carved wood. i couldn't help but buy a few carved animals.
the family went to a native american festival. <eos> we met some very talented and unique people while we were there. <eos> this is a basket that was made by the natives. <eos> we participated in the singing and dancing. <eos> its fascinating watching a master work.
what a unique place to visit. <eos> it had stood for such a long time. <eos> everywhere you looked had a spectacular view. <eos> the world was just different from here. <eos> it had great natural defenses that made it impenetrable.
you know, honey, when you said we were going to live in a cave, i wasn't so sure it was a good idea. <eos> but the views here are amazing. <eos> and such a beautiful little town. <eos> this place has a lovely garden. <eos> and the nearest shopping mall isn't so far away.
"this castle was the whole reason we came to this town.  <eos> the ""secret"" entrance to the caves below the castle. <eos> a picturesque, traditional town,  <eos> view from the castle ramparts.  <eos> "sure glad we don't have to scale those cliffs under archery fire.

our first to europe. <eos> this was the place we stayed at. <eos> this was the site from our place. <eos> we got to travel down this hil. <eos> then we had to hike up the hill again
to all of those moms and dads who are willing to sacrifice everything for all of us, thank you. <eos> for those little people, who have to wait for daddy to get home for a hug, thank you. <eos> midnight feedings don't seem so bad, if we think about what your midnights have been like. <eos> thank you, daddy, for preserving her freedom. <eos> and thank you, for inspiring a whole new generation.
the families were waiting in anticipation for their loved one to return home. <eos> the unit got off the bus and were congratulated by their fellow soldiers. <eos> the unit starts to file into the gym and see their families. <eos> a poster announcing what unit was returning home. <eos> the television news came and produced a story on the unit's homecoming.
although these pictures are sweet are they really needed. <eos> we see this as inspiring but shouldnt it be sad. <eos> these men only go to war cause of the hatred in the world. <eos> we get so happy to see them home, but why send them in the first place. <eos> kids should not be denied their parents. 
this is a picture of a crowd.  <eos> this is a picture of the army. <eos> this is a picture of soldiers. <eos> this is a picture of a sign. <eos> this is an interview.
it was an emotional moment when the soldiers came home to their family. <eos> many fathers were greeted by their children, of whom they hadn't seen in over a yeaar. <eos> one soldier even came home to a surprise, a baby boy! <eos> it wasn't all boys at this reunion either, as a little girl gave her father a hug. <eos> the soldiers had quite a bit of luggage to bring home and some were happy to help.
the valley was spacious and open. <eos> the water fell from the top of the cliff quickly. <eos> the sign was green and not very informative. <eos> the horse assisted us with carrying resources. <eos> my partner had a really exciting time at the field.

the mitchell family wanted to take a vacation in nature. they traveled to a river near mountains. <eos> they saw a waterfall coming out of the mountain and thought is was beautiful. <eos> the family hiked to middal hole point and decided to rest. <eos> sarah lost her favorite bracelet and they had to stop and search for it. <eos> she was so happy when they finally found it.
we started the hike in the misty early morning. <eos> before long, we were passing some amazing waterfalls. <eos> around midday, we made it to kiddal hole point. <eos> we were tired, and very glad there were horses to rent to ride there! <eos> laura loved the day, and she looked beautiful outdoors.

a little wild pig sniffs around for some food. <eos> a very beautiful flower hidden among the other plants. <eos> there was a boardwalk that went over the really wet parts of the swamp. <eos> a snake slithered away from the group. <eos> this hollow stump seemed to go down forever. 
we paid to go on a trip to the forest. <eos> there was a swampy looking area, <eos> but right after that there were beautiful flowers. <eos> the trees were majestic. <eos> and all we could do was stare at the wonders god created.
we travel to the wild <eos> once we go there we can see the flowers. <eos> then we start to walk across the bridge <eos> then we reach the other side. <eos>  finally we get to a cave.

the team went on a team building exercise. <eos> some of the members of the group created rafts with tubes and long poles. <eos>  other members of the group carried individual tubes on sticks to the water. <eos> after the rafts were constructed many of the team members put them in the water to test them out. <eos> even though we were wet at the end of the day we felt as sense of accomplishment.
my club met for a fun camping trip. <eos> we had to do team-building exercises to build trust. <eos> carrying the tires was the hardest part. <eos> we got to play with the tires afterward. <eos> my team did a victory pose and went to eat fish after.
teamwork was key.  <eos> in everything that required more than one.  <eos> working together to achieve a common goal.  <eos> the oracle knew that.  <eos> and these guys were one of the best teams they'd ever had. 
we were honored to have a local representative come to our military banquet. <eos> we worked hard making a great lunch that day and he was served just like everyone else. <eos> the representative gave a very encouraging speech during the meal. <eos> he took time to go to each table and speak to everyone in attendance. <eos> he presented his with a volunteer t-shirt after the dinner was over.

the family took a trip to a foreign bazaar.  <eos> while looking around they noticed all sorts of colorful and lovely designs. <eos> the mother especially liked the unique teapot designs. <eos> the grandparents tested out instruments, but they didn't sound so good. <eos> to avoid the embarrassing music from her grandparents, the daughter went to a neighboring shop and looked at cute dresses.
we go to the town fair. <eos> there was a lot of food and we saw everyone we knew. <eos>  they had awesome souvenirs for sale. <eos>  then they put on a show. <eos>  we all had a blast, it was time to go

a devastating hurricane has ruined a lot of homes in colorado. relief efforts are being discussed carefully by members of the armed forces and some community volunteers. <eos> the relief team captain talks about their efforts to make sure that everyone gets the relief they need and that no one gets left out. <eos> civilian volunteers enjoy devoting their time for a cause. <eos> helping each other does do great things. <eos> food and medicine successfully reached the victims of the calamity.
military and citizen volunteers gathered to discuss how to deal with the recent crisis. <eos> city leaders got involved, learning exactly what needed to be done. <eos> some of the volunteers handled the sandbags. <eos> others were on hand to direct traffic. <eos> it truly was an inspiring group effort.
it was going to flood soon. <eos> it was explained how they were going to mitigate the flooding. <eos> people volunteered to put up sandbags. <eos> they set up a line to keep the bags moving. <eos> a lot of sandbags had to be put out.
there was a high risk of flooding in the area so the local national guard met with town officials to plan a response. <eos> local residents watched excitedly as the barriers were set-up. <eos> everyone worked together to place the sandbags. <eos> it required a lot of coordination to get all the materials in place. <eos> it was a serious job but doing it right meant we could all start to lighten up a little.
we had a meeting to discuss the plans <eos> the director gave further directions outside <eos> then we all got to work <eos> everything was going smooth, and we were getting things done <eos> everyone chipped in, and it was a great success
a bomb was made by this army. <eos> it was very well as you can see it took many years to accomplish this. <eos> the bomb is put away in a safe for safety reasons. <eos> the general talks about the power it has. <eos> the officials come in and show the paperwork on the bomb.

careful, that's live.  <eos> one spark and this place would blow.  <eos> kaboom, that'd be all she wrote.  <eos> don't forget the sandbags.  <eos> easy, easy with those torpedoes.
this is a big explosive shell.  <eos> there are lots of shells and other weapons in the share house.  <eos> the weapons were unboxed and inspected.  <eos> the shells were brought out for inspection.  <eos> they prepared to load them on ship.

the home team was ready for today's big game. <eos> the visiting team huddles for a bit prior to the start of the game. <eos> there seemed to be some sort of issue that needed to be resolved between the coaches. <eos> after a few minutes, some technicality was explained and soon everyone took position. <eos> the game started and proved to be a very exciting afternoon.
at this school, soccer ruled.  <eos> if you couldn't play you could stand on the side and look like you did.  <eos> get that ball, ya bruiser.  <eos> give me that ball.  <eos> ut oh, a whistle was blown, make that two whistles.

this small city sits outside a large mountain range. <eos> there is a small window overlooking the town. <eos> a small house is located in town and people enjoy visiting it. <eos> the town itself is run down and old but has a lot of soul. <eos> the building with the tree in front of it is a magistrates building.
we went to a mexican village <eos> the colors were very vivid on the houses <eos> there was even someone painting a house while we were there  <eos> the whole town was incredibly bright <eos> the buildings date back to the 1800's
this our first trip to an island. <eos> on the island people keep their windows open. <eos>  we got to walk arond for a bit <eos> then we go tot see this old building. <eos>  after that we head downtown to finish the day 
the mountains are seen in the distance behind some beautiful apartments <eos> all of us deciding where we are going to eat. <eos> we see some painters redoing some buildings. <eos> the whole downtown area is being restored. <eos> it really looks great after the painters.
our hotel was tucked away in the hills, and we had a great view. <eos> here in the window to my bedroom. i left it open because i liked hearing the street noises below. <eos> this elderly couple could be seen each morning watching passersby. <eos> i loved the colors of the buildings. you never see combinations like this back home! <eos> here is the avenue i took each day from the hotel to the train.
a couple went out to research local flora. <eos> the husband took pictures of different plants. <eos> these trees were his favorite. <eos> the wife enjoyed these flowers growing out of two rocks. <eos> they recorded their findings when they returned home.
jack and jill went for a hike.  <eos> they cam across a nature photographer.  <eos> the photographer asked jill to pose for him.  <eos> so she did in a house. <eos> and she also also posed outside. 
sal and i decided to take a nature hike today. we both wore hats to protect from the sun. <eos> sal had a great time taking pictures with the camera i got him for his birthday. <eos> we found this cool old tree and sal snapped a picture. <eos> this is me behind a rock relaxing a bit from the hike. <eos> we finally found our destination i thought we were going for a hike but sal surpised me with a cabin in the woods.
the pair went out on a hike. <eos> he stopped to take a picture of a bug on the ground. <eos> they took a picture of the hill in the background. <eos> they signed the guest book at the cottage. <eos> they took a picture of the cottage in the distance.
me and my dad are both ecologists and we always go on trips together. <eos> when documenting shrub growth you need a strong attention to detail. <eos> some of these trees are hundreds of years old. <eos> my dad says i am always taking it too easy. <eos> after a long day out we had to log our findings.
the site for the excavations was headed up by a small team of researchers from a local university. <eos> they were happy to be able to be working on a site so close to the city. <eos> the team excavated small square sections, on at a time. <eos> the dirt was sifted through box frames with wire screening. <eos> these are a few of the relics that have been uncovered so far.
the men are excavating looking for artifacts. <eos> they have troughs set up to clean anything that they do find. <eos> they dug a huge hole in the ground as they have been looking. <eos> there are buckets by the hole where they put items in. <eos> one item that was found was an old vintage bottle.
sign in a trash can while they work in the back. <eos> the workers are working and getting ready to start to build.  <eos> they start to dig up soil to build what they are going to build. <eos> they take the dirt/soil and put it inside some wood. <eos> then they begin test to see what kind of soil it is.
the archaeologists get to work bright and early in the morning. <eos> three of them are sifting through rocks. <eos> one of them is digging a rectangle hole. <eos> another sifts through the rubble more carefully than the others. <eos> so far, they've found a bottle in the excavation site.
the excavation crew were on a dig. <eos> they set up sifting boxes so they could sift through the dirt that was dug up. <eos> it was hard work digging all that dirt. <eos> each sifting box was painstakingly checked for items. <eos> these are some of the items that were found.
a storm was coming to the area. many people were making precautions. the city just sat there, not knowing what was coming. <eos> first, was a blast of snow that hit the area. it looked like a lightening strike. <eos> later, the snow covered the ground. the snow made it difficult to walk through the city. <eos> many people were ready to help out their neighbors and friends after the storm hit. <eos> though it was dangerous, it was beautiful too. the snow covered ground looked calm and peaceful.
a rainy day with a convey of trucks waiting to unload. <eos> the man checks in the truck making sure all is correct. <eos> the truck driver and checker chat outside. <eos> a picture of the drivers and checkers. <eos> another truck waiting to be unloaded.
the hard workers did not let the rain prevent them from making their deliveries. <eos> they stopped for a quick talk before heading off for more deliveries.  <eos> he is clarifying the order before driving off.  <eos> they all found time for a quick group picture.  <eos> these guys wanted to snap a quick picture in front of the truck. 
i drove by and saw a truck pulled over on the highway. <eos> he told me he was sick of his company that he worked for because his truck kept breaking down. <eos> i gave him my contact info for my trucking company. <eos> he then quit his company and joined mine. <eos> he quickly became acquainted with the fellow workers of the new company.
a truck stop can be a busy place. <eos> members of the truckers union work to gain new membership. <eos> they visit with each trucker that they can.  <eos> soon many new members are recruited.  <eos> the friendship and support that members get from their union is immense.
jake was in the mood to take some pictures so he climbed up this mountain and took this picture. <eos> after that he decided to take some pictures of nature starting with this spider. <eos> then he thought it would be amusing to take a picture of his car from a far distance away. <eos> after that he took a picture of this hawk. <eos> the hawk was soaring high and jake is so proud of this picture that he took.
we bought a house on a mountain <eos> it was an amazing place <eos> so peaceful  <eos> the wild life is incredible <eos> the scenery makes for life to be lived at its fullest
we arrived at the house in the mountains. <eos> it was very well kept but the patio and fire pit needed some attention. <eos> the guest house was pretty but had a strange style. <eos> from the deck, we could see hawks and buzzards soaring over the mountains. <eos> we didn't have a bird's eye view, but ours was more than pretty enough for us.
i enjoy visiting my grandparent's home up in the mountains. <eos> i get to see nature up close, like a spider in a web. <eos> after i park the car, it's time for a long walk. <eos> on certain days, i can usually spot an eagle flying overhead. <eos> i sometimes watch the direction the eagle is flying in and i follow it.
it sat perched atop a tree.  <eos> it was a hunter.  <eos> a mighty hunter, from the sky.  <eos> it would swoop down for its prey.  <eos> then carry it away to be eaten. 
the career festival was a good opportunity for many people to find a new job. <eos> there were over 100 companies that had set up booths. <eos> some offered hands on training. <eos> others showed demonstrations of what they did. <eos> there were also presidents from some of the companies who gave speeches.
a fun event was planned for the evening. <eos> this little kid is helping out with the saw. <eos> these kids are learning all about how to make stuff out of wood. <eos> a real hands on experience is being given to the children.  <eos> after the work is done they sit down and listen to the teacher teach them more about how to make stuff out of wood.
carpentry and wood working show was organized in atlanta.  <eos> children learned how to cut the wood with a saw.  <eos> there was a demonstration on making wooden design using special software. <eos> children learned how to use hammer and nails.  <eos> the show ended with the closing remarks from mr. smith, the best carpenter in atlanta. 
each year i enjoy going to the exploratorium workshop. <eos> it's a family oriented event, with plenty of things for kids to see and do. <eos> my favorite area is the woodworking display. <eos> they show you how to make many nice items with wood. <eos> there are also many interesting guest speakers at the event.
step right up, step right up, glad to help ya.  <eos> vendors were hawking their wares.  <eos> it was hard to tell what some things were but people will buy strange things.  <eos> pet rocks for instance.  <eos> he had come up with the idea. 
the town reminded me of a movie scene. <eos> more than half of the population worked at the jiffy factory. <eos> a large map on the side of a building told us where we were. <eos> we made it to the church before the pastor left. <eos> then we had lunch at a diner called purple rose.
todd wanted to visit the jiffy mixes plant. <eos> he pulls up to the plant in excitement. <eos> this is the real jiffy plant he thought to himself. <eos> he tries to find some parking for the plant but is unable to find a spot to park. <eos> so he parks his card in in town square and walks over to the plant.
took a little road trip to a town i had never been to before. <eos> stopped by the jiffy plant for a few pictures. <eos> found this huge map on the side of a building that was helpful for getting around the town. <eos> ran across this building with interesting achitecture as i was driving around. <eos> last stop was the purple rose before heading home.
this town was famous, well kind of.  <eos> mabel white holmes was from here and in 1930 she invented jiffy mixes.  <eos> a map on a wall directed you on a walking tour.  <eos> you could visit the old mill.  <eos> if that didn't float your boat, you could always go to the purple rose. 
one day, the friends decided to take a day trip to the historic downtown area. <eos> downtown there were lots of little shops and historic buildings to see. <eos> many of the old areas were full of rich culture and history. there was a large guide map to help tourists as well. <eos> there were a few churches and beautiful buildings in the area. we stopped to see everything. <eos> the day all in all was wonderful. we would love to visit again and our last stop to the purple rose was a experience we won't ever forget.
we captured the creature that had been causing such a disturbance. <eos> it was necessary to bind the gator. <eos> people from the wildlife preserve agreed to have a look at him. <eos> they showed us where they would be taking the alligator. <eos> it was a facility dedicated to prehistoric animals.
the zoo got a new gator <eos> they needed to place it in the new habitat  <eos> the gator didn't take to his new surroundings <eos> so them moved him to a different location <eos> he seems content now
workers carefully move the box. <eos> workers examine the contents any potential damage in shipping. <eos> they find all in order, they will prepare this for the display shortly. <eos> the director and her helper prepared to opening the jurassic park museum. <eos> the big yellow dinosaur is a great draw to get visitors to the museum.
we are here to unravel a really cool surprise for children big and small. <eos> rain or shine, here we go. get that thing opened. <eos> it took 4 people to get it open and put together. <eos> ok, ready for the unveiling? let's see what this is. <eos> a huge dinosaur. this is great, the kids will love this.
woowee! nothing like a day of gator wrestling! we got this gator from someone's backyard pond, shipped him in a crate to habitat. <eos> once we had him out of the crate, it was time to move him into his closure. <eos> we still had to unwrap him, then run like heck out of there! <eos> afterwards, we left the area with our boat. <eos> the place that took him looks like an upstanding establishment! 
having fun at the company picnic. <eos> an employee is having some lunch. <eos> two co-workers share a laugh. <eos> entertainment was brought in for the picnic. <eos> a couple dances to the music.
the event at the park featured a very large buffet served under a tent. <eos> the local men that served were extremely charming and very generous. <eos> i was amazed at the turnout of so many people in the community. <eos> some of the night's entertainment featured local singers. <eos> one lady in particular was extremely talented and she was accompanied by guitar.
there was a big party in the park near my house. there was catered food and games. <eos> the food was delicious and everyone was full and happy. <eos> people were having a good time and having conversations. <eos> there was even live music! <eos> the music was great and people danced. overall, the party was fun and a success.
our town had a hawaiian festival this year. <eos> it was a lot of fun and there was a lot of food, too! <eos> the police officers were there to make sure no trouble started, but of course there wasn't any. <eos> my grandma is the mayor, but she sings, too. <eos> i like to listen to her sing and play her tambourine.
there was a hawaiian bbq contest at the park this weekend. <eos> all the local bbq enthusiasts were there competing and giving everyone a taste. <eos> we had such a fun time and even got flower necklaces. <eos> they had live entertainment. <eos> and there was dancing on into the night.
on our evening walk we found a soccer team having a match at a local park. <eos> the blue team was from our local community, so we naturally cheered for them. <eos> the opposing team was from a nearby city and they played very wel. <eos> our local team was very aggressive with the ball but they had their work cut out for them. <eos> the game went on even after the sun went down, but i was glad we stayed and watched.
it was the night of peters soccer match. <eos> his team needed just one win to be in first place. <eos> peter got on the field and a rainbow showed up must mean good luck or something. <eos> the game was underway and peter was playing very hard for his team. <eos> fighting for victory peter scores 3 goals and helps his team win the game.
the soccer match was hotly contested, and these players fought for the ball.  <eos> after scoring a goal, teammates celebrated.  <eos> one player patrols his area of the field during the match.  <eos> players milled around during a brief stoppage in the action.  <eos> the game ended with the blue team kicking the ball around. 
today we went to watch my brother play soccer. <eos> he scored the first goal and received warm hugs from his teammates. <eos> a beautiful rainbow appeared behind him. <eos> they played through the rain. <eos> i am proud of my brother for winning the game for his team.
the game had started with a lot of anticipation. <eos> both teams had been preparing for this showdown since the beginning of the season. <eos> the game was intense, and the score was kept close. <eos> neither side was prepared to give an inch! <eos> night began to fall and the lights came on with the score still tied!
the art convention has begun. <eos> special backgrounds is the focus. <eos> brainstorming is an effective technique to generate ideas. <eos> odd shapes are often right in front of us if we choose to notice. <eos> mixing colors is inspiring.
the cafe was crowded. <eos> the bikes weren't being used. <eos> the symbols on the walls confused people. <eos> the storage room was packed. <eos> they needed to get organized.
the diner was furnished and lit. <eos> inside the studio, some bikes were parked. <eos> this man wore a very interesting trench coat. <eos> the sculpture was a very nice and tall. <eos> the blue ocean was lovely.
the small cafe next to gallery is where i ate almost every night. <eos> while a lot of work had been completed for the grand opening, there was still more to do. <eos> that also included trying to figure out how to display some of the artwork. <eos> and making sure that our space was as organized as possible.  <eos> which also meant that some things would just have to be stuck in a corner.
eating dinner with friends. <eos> bike riding to the studio. <eos> examining a blank canvas with blank cross in it.  <eos> the work station <eos> blue and green paint spray on a canvas.
it was quiet outside. <eos> inside, there was only two people getting ready for work. <eos> nothing interesting was happening, no one even playing sports on the field. <eos> the car park was empty, sans some parked cars. <eos> indeed, this was a boring day. 
the school was practically deserted during the summer.  <eos> we walked through a few deserted classrooms and hallways. <eos> in the cafeteria a few students were setting up chairs for the big event. we stopped to help.  <eos> after we finished we headed out to the sports field.  <eos> we climbed up to the highest place we could reach in the bleachers and looked out over the field. 
this facility was recently constructed. <eos> it features a large indoor space for activities. <eos> there is ample dining space. <eos> outside there is opportunity for parking. <eos> fields are available for sport.
this is the building that was next to the park we visited. <eos> the cafeteria had food that was very enjoyable. <eos> the park is very big and grassy. <eos> the lot was occupied by a couple of visitors and workers. <eos> the world always seems to impress the best of us.
an event planner pulls up to an empty parking lot and takes a picture of the space for their client. <eos> inside the building they are given a tour of the facilities to see the space that is avaliable. <eos> there are several large open rooms that are available for rent for a large event. <eos> as they step outside the planner takes a picture of the secondary parking lot for additional guests. <eos> finally they take a picture of the view from the balcony of one of the event spaces, showing a soccer field with a quiet forest behind.
we saw an eagle at the bird sanctuary  <eos> there were so many different species  <eos> even seagulls  <eos> the owl was a crowd favorite <eos> the bird is so graceful in the sky 
this little guy was chirping for a mate. <eos> this hawk was on the lookout for some food. <eos> this little bird had already found some breakfast. <eos> a bird swimming along searching for some food. <eos> a shrike prowling the field for some food.
i went on vacation in wyoming. <eos> well there i got to go on a guided tour in a wildlife bird sanctuary. <eos>  i had never seen so many different types of birds. <eos> a tour guide was very knowledgeable and knew every bird we saw. <eos> it was such an amazing experience, i cannot wait to go again.
have you ever gone outside and just marveled at birds? <eos> they're so majestic in the way they act. from sitting still... <eos> ... to flying. they swift through the thin air.  <eos> despite their small size their boldness stands out. <eos> their warriors of the air and i'll never get tired of studying and watching them.
the hawk soared majestically, giving us a sense of awe. <eos> this guy was a little more on the cute end of the spectrum. <eos> we saw many types of birds over the day. <eos> including this one sitting on a post. <eos> but it was the birds of prey that really drew attention.
the children gathered around the tables. <eos> there were quite a few boys this time. <eos> it was make your own snack day. <eos> they had peanut butter and crackers. <eos> they could design things with the supplies provided.
if it's summer is must be summer day camp. <eos> making lunch with the other campers. <eos> sitting in a circle for story time. <eos> listening to the speaker at camp. <eos> going fishing at the end of the day.
everyone in attendance was clearly excited. <eos> there were a lot of smiles to be found! <eos> a lot of bonding took place with the kids. <eos> of course some appetites got worked up along the way. <eos> but everyone had a great time.
i volunteer for the boys and girls club, and today we had a day camp for the kids. <eos> we helped them make food crafts that they could eat. <eos> we sat around in a circle and told stories. <eos> then we had a park ranger discuss safety with them. <eos> finally, we let them try out fishing in the creek!

the deer crossed the ice carefully. <eos> it saw an eagle on a post. <eos> the eagle waited for the deer. <eos> the eagle avoided the ice entirely. <eos> it was alone as the deer couldn't get to it.
i visited the tundra. <eos> i saw many animals, surprisingly. <eos> it was extremely cold. <eos> every trace of water was frozen. <eos> it was a good learning experience, but it was so cold that i don't think i'm going to come back.
it was difficult to see.  <eos> almost a white out.  <eos> the small natural lake had frozen.  <eos> creatures were having a hard time finding their next meal.  <eos> one bird stood so still for so long he appeared frozen.

going to a wild bird rehabilitation center can be an eye opening trip.  <eos> some of these beautiful birds have been hurt in accidents, and these people get them healed up and back into the air.  <eos> bob here has trained this golden eagle to fly around and come back to land on his gloved hand.  <eos> while not all the birds may be attractive, they are all still important.  <eos> i had never seen an owl like this up close in daylight, and he was gorgeous. 
birds are majestic creatures. <eos> they soar wild, untamed, and free. <eos> though with the right trainer, most birds can be taught to be handled by humans. <eos> a bird belongs to itself, though. <eos> you cannot contain it's spirit.
today i got to see a bird fly. <eos>  the bird first landed right by me. <eos> then it took off soaring in the air again. <eos>  it spread it large wings and flew away. <eos> i finallly saw it land close to its home

during a battle with a terrorist group, we decided to scope out the area. we found that the terrorists were holding children hostage. <eos> as the expert sniper, i took out tons of terrorists without there being any casualties. <eos> the children were happy to be saved. <eos> to finish off the terrorists, we had someone get in the turret and mow down all of them as they ran at us in a last ditch effort. they failed, and we won. <eos> we celebrated our win, and to make the children feel better, we gave them gift. it was a good day.
the area at the border is really tense.  <eos> snipers are always ready for whatever's coming.  <eos> the locals are used to the guards.  <eos> the soldiers always seem to be on edge, but their used to their mission.  <eos> some are more laid back, but still at the ready. 
there was once an american sniper. <eos> he was the best in his class and has saved many lives during his tour. <eos> he makes the hard decisions of classifying someone as an enemy or civilian. <eos> his decisions are the difference between mass casualty or a single death. <eos> to shoot or not is the permanent question in his head.

we went to europe and visited some old cathedrals. <eos> they were located right off the river. <eos> the streets still looked like cobblestone. <eos> the bridges were new though. <eos> we enjoyed the views of the water and old town.
when i was in elementary school, we had a day called field day. <eos> on field day, all the kids in school would dress up in their favorite colors and compete against eachother. <eos> we would race, jump, dribble, and climb. <eos> sometimes we would do this in the gym. <eos> the most important thing with these silly games was to have fun.

after a long winter, the weather has thawed, and the zoo animals are enjoying the outdoors. <eos> although ice remains on some surfaces, the lions took their chances on this slippery tree trunk. <eos> not all animals enjoyed the outdoors as some nocturnal creatures, like this monkey, would have rather stayed inside in the dark. <eos> the weather warmed up enough allowing even for the tropical flamingos to have a good time. <eos> despite the warmer weather, the number of human visitors at the zoo remained small today.
we saw so many animals during our visit to the zoo.  <eos> the lions looked ferocious! <eos> the ape looked like my brother.  <eos> we even saw a flamingo drinking in the water.  <eos> on the way out we saw a glimpse of a giraffe to end the day. 
our visit to the zoo was quite a huge treat. of course, we started with the tiger. <eos> right next to him was the lions. i love to watch them interact. <eos> the chimp watches us as much as we watch him. <eos> my daughter loves the flamingos. i always tell her about how they are pink from eating shrimp. <eos> my son's favorite animal is the giraffe. i think it's because he wants to be very tall someday!

there year me and my husband went to a halloween costume party. <eos> our friends jack and anna dressed up as breakfast at tiffany's. <eos> i loved the girls iconic outfits. <eos> there is always room for two at costumes parties. <eos> one of my favorite costumes were this group, they stole the show.
young people went to a costume contest to see who was the best at cosplay. <eos> there were flamingo dancers pumping up the energy of the party. <eos> a wanna be einstein  <eos> along with not so pretty dallas cowgirls also participated in a smaller capacity. <eos> but the one who won the contest was the under-dressed bat girl.
he thought the girls dressed as cops were hot.  <eos> not to mention the girls on stage.  <eos> he had dressed as einstein.  <eos> he hit on the girls dressed as dallas cowboys cheerleaders until he realized they were men.  <eos> but then he saw a scantily clad girl and went for that. 
the club was having a costume night. <eos> a lot of women dressed up in scantily clad garments. <eos> albert einstein made an appearance at the nightclub. <eos> a troupe of high school cheerleaders danced their way in the club. <eos> everyone drank and danced a lot and lots of fun was had. 
every year there is a lobster festival in maine.  <eos> first they put these blue tubs out.  <eos> the tubs are then covered with plastic.  <eos> once that is done they put water in the tubs.  <eos> the lobsters are then place in the tubs for the guest to choose from. 
in the city that night, there were a lot of lights and people. <eos> i think the camera crew was setting up a scene. <eos> there was a plastic pool in the middle of the road. <eos> we chose to pay more attention to the random walkway. <eos> my friend found this smaller replica of a bus.
they stand outside and begin taking the plastic off. <eos> more people gather in support and to help them. <eos> midway through, a break was taken. <eos> the scenery was observed before continuing with the project. <eos> finally finished, they begin garnishing the relic.

my friends an i went to a rally.  <eos> there were some policeman guarding the event. <eos> it's wonderful so many people gathered to fight for the cause.  <eos> i saw a person carrying a chair, so he can sit somewhere during the rally. <eos> hundreds of people gathered at the rally. 
they were determined to fight for their cause <eos> people from all around joined in on it <eos> they rioted through the streets picking up anything they could <eos> the police tried their best to keep hold of the situation <eos> all in all it turned out to be pretty peaceful protest 
"protesters marched holding a signed that read ""reclaim the streets."" <eos> thousands of people gathered in the street for a good cause. <eos> a man carrying a chair attempted to make a bold but silent statement.  <eos> the cop stood looking at the crowd to ensure a peaceful protest.  <eos> "the protesters marched the streets for hours. 
the people protested with a big banner <eos> and there were many on bicycles. <eos> one man had a chair <eos> and the police could not believe it <eos> so they evacuated the streets.

getting to ed's favorite diner was not easy. <eos> it involved a boat ride down the river. <eos> ed's brother had a boat, though, so that made it a little better. <eos> when ed and his brother saw the sign for the diner at the dock, they were elated! <eos> they ordered their favorites, sitting at the bar, and watched the chef cook them up excitedly.

we left on the subway to get to the convention venue. <eos> hundreds of people and computers were lined up. <eos> we pulled an all-nighter and only broke briefly to eat. <eos> we were at it so long that we got kind of punchy from lack of sleep. <eos> it was a really fun way to spend our weekend in the city.
the party started off like any other. <eos> there was some delicious cake. <eos> and we opened presents as well. <eos> things started to get wilder as the night went on. <eos> it was certainly a night no one will forget.
this year, we got emily a wonder woman costume for her birthday. <eos> we brought some cupcakes. <eos> emily's best friend baked her a cake. <eos> one of the guys showed us how to write using light afterwards. <eos> then we played some board games where losers had to do some humiliating things. it was a great night.
it was fainally time for the birthday girl to take center stage. <eos> we brought out the cake and she blew out the candles. <eos> she unwrapped some of her gifts right afterward. <eos> later we had some fun playing with streamers outside. <eos> it's probably best not to ask about some games we played.
bringing out the birthday cake. <eos> make and wish and blow out your candles!!! <eos> posing w/ wonder woman gifts, so awesome. <eos> danny broke out her poi and put on a little show. <eos> i don't even know what it going on here but someone is getting frisky.

the local battle of the bands started with some typical vandalism. one of the signal lights was damaged. <eos> the bands started playing and this year, they were pretty good. <eos> the sound system was pretty terrible though. <eos> hundreds of people came for a listen. <eos> afterwards, we found some cardboard cutouts and we decided to play some carnival games with them.

i went to the bar to meet my friends. <eos> they were already drinking when i got there. <eos> we had great conversation. <eos> i had a few cigarettes while i was hanging out with them. <eos> i had a great time.
she was drinking too much that night.  <eos> she was completely unaware of the beer foam on her mouth.  <eos> not wanting to embarrass her he kissed the foam off.  <eos> he was always protective of her, which was one of the reasons she loved him.  <eos> if only he could get her to stop smoking he thought to himself. 
all of our friends gathered at the local bar for some fun times.  <eos> david decided to light up a cigarette. <eos> david became distracted at the basketball game on television. <eos> nancy became so drunk that she missed her mouth while eating cake. <eos> after wiping off her face from her cake eating mishap, nancy decided to have a smoke. 
we hadn't seen lindsay in awhile but when we did, we started right where we left off. drinking. <eos> she somehow got to eat some cake sometime during the night. <eos> she found her old boyfriend too. they started to make out almost immediately. <eos> they couldn't keep their hands off each other all night. <eos> as the night wore on, they were less intimate, which was a relief to us.
it was the fight of the festival and what way to start it off then my drinking. <eos> we played various drinking games with our friends. <eos> by the end of it we were pretty drunk. <eos> some of us didn't really come out of it to well. <eos> after sobering up we went on to other festival activities.
all over the world people protest as a way to get their message out no matter how wrong or hateful it may be. <eos> here is an older poster of people protesting the g8 summit and they are calling to an end to corporate power. <eos> here is another poster where people somewhere in the world are protesting the dropping of bombs as a solution. <eos> in still another part of the world trade justice signs are being seen like in this picture. <eos> the lists of groups and places protesting is endless from europe to north america and all across the globe it will never end as long as people are not happy with the situation they are in.

the guests had arrived at the reading of their eccentric relative's will. it was late in the evening and nerves are on edge. <eos> they all regard each other with suspicion. one guest had already died under suspicious circumstances. <eos> the deputy was stumped, he knew there was a murderer but could not determine who. <eos> everyone professed innocence . . . indeed, some were not sure any foul play was afoot! <eos> revealed! the identity of the assassin stunned them all!
janice was unhappy with her gift. <eos> bob poured himself another glass of wine. <eos> dave was also enjoying the wine. <eos> tina loved the new gloves she received. <eos> at the end of the day chris played with his new toy gun.

two friend play guitar at the party. <eos> banging out a beat on the drums. <eos> strumming the guitar for the fans. <eos> three friends have a jam session. <eos> the man is doing his big guitar solo.
my friend and i went to a charity concert to benefit kids in need.  <eos> a lot of different artist played and donated their time and talent to the charity.  <eos> the guitars are always my favorite.  <eos> then everyone came out and played together. it was amazing.  <eos> this was my favorite singer/guitar player. he was awesome!! 
my favorite band has a top-tier guitarist.  <eos> to me, the band's drummer is even better. <eos> he can handle at least five different styles of drumming. <eos> the band wouldn't be the same though without the contributions of every member. <eos> i could listen to these guys play for days.
our trip to the ski lodge was a ton of fun! <eos> they had great food for every meal. <eos> the vast array of options was magnificent.  <eos> the snow pack was light, but beautiful nonetheless. <eos> the scenery alone was worth the trip.
i ordered a lot of food. <eos> after i ate i got back on the road. <eos> there was a lot of snow on the road. <eos> i went for a drive. <eos> it took me a couple hours to get back home.
it was a great day for a hike. <eos> but breakfast came first. <eos> the table was full of goodies. <eos> then the trail was ready. <eos> it was too snowy outside.
here at a small town in japan. we are being treated so nice. <eos> here is the building we are staying in. this is a loving place. 5 stars. <eos> decided to take a long walk down this street. i left here with 100's of pictures. <eos> i love the snow as black and white, i love the tree and all of this picture. <eos> this picture just looks great, sun is in the perfect position.
this odd shaped restaurant is actually modern looking to me and this is where we are going to have a great meal.  <eos> this is my plate i like to try new things doesn't it look awesome? <eos> a smorgasbord of different asian cuisine looks very interesting.  <eos> the icy road leaving the restaurant and it looks like a stephen king movie. lol...  <eos> epic view of a cold winter day. 
the pre-opera tailgate was a success. <eos> we included lots of champagne for everyone. <eos> the wide variety of cheeses went well with the champagne. <eos> what was supposed to be just a snack, ended up being so filling that we were able to skip dinner. <eos> we had so much left that we were able to include anyone who passed by!
she stood at the porch waiting for her date.  <eos> once he got arrived, she realized she had forgotten to tell him to wear black slacks and a tie.  <eos> he made a quick change and was the first to pop a bottle of champagne.  <eos> all the women had dresses on.  <eos> there was an array of finger foods on the small table. 
yesterday, i went to a wonderful tailgating party. <eos> they really went all out to set it up. <eos> they had waiters and served champagne. <eos> everyone got very dressed up. <eos> i had a wonderful time at the event.
great food and great conversation, there is nothing like getting together with friends and family. <eos> uncle steve topping off his glass. he loves a good drink. <eos> dad and uncle steve they are always together. <eos> mom and cousin tami. mom always know were to find the food. <eos> the perfect way to end the vacation with a table set up for all friends and family before departure.

out to dinner with friends. we are trying a new place. <eos> everyone ordered something different so we could all try it. <eos> we weren't sure what this was, but i guess we'll try it. <eos> this didn't look any better but i'll give it a go. <eos> had to wash it all down with lots of drinks. still a fun night.
i made a lot of food for the party tonight. <eos> i spent time making some sauces. <eos> it took me a few hours. <eos> everyone enjoyed it. <eos> there were a lot of leftovers afterward.
the friends gathered for a meal. <eos> the dishes were placed on the table. they all looked amazing! <eos> each dish was fresh and appetizing. <eos> the friends gobbled up their food. <eos> then they made some drinks. it was a great time.
it was time to have a super dinner with family, <eos> we started out with all these taco ingredients, <eos> then we moved to this squid like substance. <eos> then we had a bunch of shrimp scampi, <eos> and finished it off with some strong drinks.
everyone was at the table drinking and chattering having a good time. <eos> the food served at the restaurant was very unique. <eos> here is one of the main courses that was served. <eos> definitely interesting food and we passed it along to each other. <eos> the drink was lit up on fire and looked exotic.
fireworks are an american tradition.  <eos> even though they were invented in china, americans use them to celebrate july 4th. <eos> the displays of patriotism are common all over the us. <eos> in most areas fireworks are illegal. <eos> they're still commonly sold because americans love to blow stuff up.
fireworks with the kids! the night was clear and warm. <eos> this red and green one reminds us of a sci-fi tree. <eos> the fireworks kept blossoming out for well over an hour. <eos> this beauty crackled and sent of little trails. <eos> only got the very beginning of the finally because i set the camera down to enjoy the stunning show!
the fireworks display was so full of color.  <eos> the red and green ones were bright, and loud.  <eos> some were colorful in a burst, like an array of color.  <eos> some rained color down like they were coming from a cloud.  <eos> the big, round bright ones indicated the finale, and it was grand. 
i wish i could be close to the action. <eos> with all the other people, with their friends. <eos> i miss my family and friends. <eos> i miss what i had in the past. <eos> i wish i didnt have to feel so alone now.
the fireworks started with a bang. <eos> everyone immediately heard the noise and looked up <eos> to see the bright colors exploding in the sky. <eos> the fireworks continued <eos> as the night went on in celebration of our country's independence.

millie sees the luncheon destination that she and her friends are looking for. <eos> they have entered and are being shown to the dining area. <eos> she knows that she is not in the usa as she sees a man lighting a cigarette inside a building. <eos> people know each other so conversations are not restricted to only the people at your table. <eos> millie loves the casual camaraderie and talks with people all over the room. it was a lunch with some excellent conversation.
 today we went to a board meetings <eos> there were lots of executives there  <eos> george wilson was sitting at a table enjoying a nice drink  <eos> then i saw brad smith chatting in the hallway and said hello  <eos> after the meeting we walked home 
this is the cafe i arrive to for the meeting. <eos> a couple of my friends are happy to see i made it. <eos> i told him to put the cigarette away, but i still captured the moment. <eos> it was fun watching everyone socializing. <eos> i caught my friend off guard at the end of the event. this was the way to end the night.
every year, my best friend and i travel with our husbands to a boutique hotel. this year, it was the smithville inn. <eos> what a lovely place! as we traditionally do, we posed first thing in the lobby. <eos> my husband bill liked the smoking allowed policy. <eos> everyone was friendly, and we talked a lot during meals. <eos> i love the hotel week of the year. it's a great chance to not be myself for a week.
the building was quite luxurious <eos> and many people came to the event. <eos> there was smoking <eos> before a sit down dinner <eos> that had a nice amount of talking.
the guys got together for drinks. <eos> they played a drinking game together at the kitchen table. <eos> adam's bandanna did not go unnoticed and many jokes were made about it. <eos> his response was to point out the silly hat that jason showed up in. <eos> then of course steven's headband became the highlight of joking.
all of my friends were at my apartment last night. <eos> we played a lot of drinking games. <eos> i wasn't very good at them. <eos> we played until late into the night. <eos> after we were done everyone had had a lot to drink.

we had pulled our friends out for a surprise party; we heard they were taking a long trip to china to see different family members, so we had a cake made. <eos> here it is, though they misspelled waung's name, though. fair enough, considering how uncommon it was. <eos> everyone was down there, though it was a real muted, work type party. <eos> waung really enjoyed it, though. he felt a little awkward at first, but he got into it after some time.  <eos> it was a pretty great party for a work-engagement type thing. i'm glad i planned it. 
i made a special cake for my friend for his birthday. <eos> i invited everyone of our friends. <eos> it was very crowded in the small apartment. <eos> everyone enjoyed the cake. <eos> some people wanted seconds.
a couple guys from our china branch came to the us for a month.  <eos> we welcomed them with a cookie cake.  <eos> the welcome event was good down time.  <eos> one of the guys wasn't used the sweetness of american food and turned down his slice.  <eos> us guys ate it up though, it was delicious. 
two friends, henry and wang, decide that they want to take a trip to china to explore their heritage. <eos> their friends decide to throw them a goodbye party and one friend made them a special desert. <eos> many friends show up to their goodbye party. <eos> henry decides he should be the one to cut the cake.  <eos> all the friends enjoy the cake that was made and wish henry and wang a safe trip.
this was the office going away party for huang and wang our representatives for china office. <eos> we got them a cake and most everyone stayed after hours to say good bye. <eos> this was the moment when they were forced to give a speech. <eos> they didn't expect this so it was quite amusing watching them try to shy away. <eos> huang making the first cut of the cake so we could finally partake. 
everyone comes to the park and gather for a good time.  <eos> once you are able to find a spot you take it for yourself. <eos> a place where you can put your tent and relax. <eos> we all sleep overnight and get ready for convention the next day.  <eos> when the show starts everybody is cooking,eating and waiting for the speaker to begin.
the sky was so blue that day, we knew it would be beautiful out. <eos> everyone had set up their tents the night before and were waiting. <eos> then, one by one they came to the stages. <eos> the stage was crowded around by so many people. <eos> the bands were so amazing to see live.
we decided to walk to the festival.  <eos> the crowds hadn't quite woken up yet.  <eos> many were still in their tents, set up by out of towners.  <eos> there were lots of test in the camping area.  <eos> but right on time, the crowd was ready to go! 
i wonderful day for a concert.  <eos> everyone began filling in.  <eos> we had our tent set up ready to go.  <eos> it was like a city just sprung up at once.  <eos> time for the show to begin, fun!
people were walking and seeing the flags <eos> before going to the open air stadium. <eos> they then went back to the tents <eos> to socialize with people. <eos> the festival continued the next day.
they arrived the night before.  <eos> lots of people camped out on the sidewalk. <eos> they set up tents to get out of the rain. <eos> there would stay there all night if they had too.  <eos> everyone made friends. 
there were a lot of people sleeping on the street when i went to new york yesterday. <eos> there were a lot of tents set up. <eos> some of the people let me examine their tents. <eos> they were very comfortable. <eos> they were ready to spend the night outdoors.
so we had an awesome opportunity presented to us. <eos> we got to camp out right inside times square. <eos> few have ever had this honor bestowed on them. <eos> yet we won a contest and got to experience it. <eos> truly it is the city that never sleeps.
the students prepared for their demonstration downtown tonight. <eos> they took their tents out of boxes <eos> and started to set them up. <eos> then they sat in them. <eos> they sat in them all night, while passerby wandered by and wondered what they were up to. 
this was us in new york preparing for a long wait. <eos> i mean long wait camping tents included. <eos> we were so lucky to be the first to arrive. <eos> we camped all night awaiting apples release of the new iphone. <eos> hot dog from street vendor were not the best idea when camping out.
there were a lot of people at the fair. <eos> some of them were drunk. <eos> they had a great time. <eos> everyone was smiling. <eos> afterward we went to the park and got dressed there.
he got ready for his big day. <eos> they chose a carnival theme for the ceremony. <eos> there were carnival rides at the reception. <eos> they even had a performance by acrobats. <eos> the couple had a great time at their wedding!
everyone is all dressed up nice to attend the festival. <eos> so many great shows this year, and talented entertainers. <eos> the rides are the best, no expense was spared. <eos> even a daring trapeze act to delight the crowd <eos> some just like to enjoy the great music.
a pristine night at the carnival after the opera. <eos> it feels good to unwind after such a regal event. <eos> makes you feel like a kid after all. <eos> and really brings out the smiles inside everyone. <eos> before we return to the prim and proper world we are accustomed to.
my good friends had a circus themed wedding!  <eos> the wedding took place under a huge red tent. <eos> there were rides for guests to enjoy! <eos> we also were treated to acrobats performing nearly impossible feats! <eos> some of us were feeling slightly tipsy, and sang and danced!
the concert was a lot of fun last night. <eos> the singer was very talented. <eos> he could also play the guitar very well. <eos> it was very loud because i was really close to the stage. <eos> i had a great time though.
"i went to see an awesome band called bloc party.  <eos> the lead singer was giving us his whole life.  <eos> as they say ""give the drummer sum""! he did an awesome solo.  <eos> the lead and bass guitarist were in unison it was epic.  <eos> "standing on the drum, wow, what a way to end the show i still can't stop thinking about it. 
we went to a concert to see our favorite singer bob singer. in the meantime we got to listen to some new groups too. <eos> this group was a lot of hard rock. they were good, but real loud. <eos> this next group was good and the drums were fantastic.  <eos> this drummer has a lot of talent and will go a lot of places in his career. <eos> the last group was just ok, i am not into the type of music he was singing but he really stirred up the audience.
thank you mom and dad for the front row seats at the bloc party concert. <eos> the lead singer takes a moment to get the crowd worked up for the drum solo. <eos> the drum solo got us even more pumped for the show. <eos> this was the last song of the night. watching these guys shred was unbelievable ! <eos> sadly enough, every good show must end sometime. how's this for an encore?
the singer is ready to do a concert getting all of his viewers excited. <eos> the singer kicks out with the first part of his concert. <eos> the next part is where the singer plays the guitar for his viewers. <eos> for the last but not least the singer plays the drums. <eos> the singer says goodbye to all of his viewers and goes home.
they filled the street and the bridge overhead. <eos> many carried signs expressing political views. <eos> some brought along flags. <eos> there were strong feelings in the crowd. <eos> the crowd eventually lessened over the day.
many people came out to support the cause today. <eos> we were one of many couples and that impressed us very much since this is so near to our hearts. <eos> many of the signs people made had compelling slogans. <eos> some people flew flags while others carried the signs. <eos> we were moved to another location eventually by the authorities.
many people gathered today to protest the war. <eos> we all stood together with our signs in peace to show our opposition. <eos> we marched down the street and held our signs. <eos> it was inspiring to see this many people band together under the same cause. <eos> at the end of the day, we all disbanded peacefully with respect knowing we had gotten our message heard.
"we had really thought that anti-war rallies were a think of the past.  <eos> but gloria and stan wanted us to go and see that they are still going on today.  <eos> sure enough, there were anti-war signs, chants, it had a real 60s feel to it.  <eos> people seem to be fed up with the whole drone ""robitic killing machine"" thing.  <eos> "but like everything else, all things end. and an hour after the protests, you couldn't even tell anything had happened there. 
there were many people at the protest. <eos> they had many signs <eos> and flags as well. <eos> they did not like the war <eos> and made this known before leaving.
here we go with another one of those school function activities where the kids dress up and meet at school to get their awards during which snack food is served. <eos> some of the students prefer to get away from the crowd to enjoy their food and it looks like they found a good place. <eos> my friend's little brother seems to have found a fancy meeting room to spend his time in and he pulled out the first aid kit just in case it is needed. <eos> now that i am finished, i will be glad to be getting back home because i really don't like crowds and these occasions. <eos> my friend wanted to take a picture of my braces to show my mom that i did not have candy stuck between my teeth.
he felt really good at the beginning of the night. <eos> the entranceway to the party. <eos> one of the party goers had a bit to much to drink <eos> picture of a very large party. <eos> friends at the entrance to the party. 
"the kid burst out of the darkness screaming ""they're coming! they're coming!"". he looked scared out of his wits. <eos> outside of the lights of the parking lot it was just darkness. who was coming? i had to know.  <eos> hey kid. wait, it looks like he has fallen into some kind of trance.  <eos> i have to warn all the others inside. but what do i tell them? they're coming? they will think i'm nuts.  <eos> "oh crap, here they come! what are they? i'm getting out of here! it's every woman for herself!
this is my last day as a normal teen. <eos> where did it all go wrong, what did i do. <eos> i was a normal boy look, i was good. <eos> no no no, its not my turn it cant be. <eos> ill be a laughing stock with these on.
adam is surprised he is having such a good night. he decided to spend the night at church with his family. <eos> adam takes some solo time and steps outside to talk to god. <eos> adam gets down on his knees. he closes his eyes and begins to pray. he thanks god for his life, then gets up and goes back into the church. <eos> in church adam's family praises the lord. adam joins them in their praise.  <eos> after church adam and his family join adam in the lot for some individual group prayer. the family that prays together stays together!
the halloween party was kicking off. <eos> it was a gore fest. <eos> it looked realistic. <eos> the blood was everywhere. <eos> not a place in the whole building wasn't touched by it.
the theme for the party was grotesque. <eos> the costumes looked very realistic. <eos> some looked like horror movie characters. <eos> refreshments matched other decor. <eos> the night was wild and entertaining.
i don't know what happened but i definitely had too much caffeine in the emergency room last night. <eos> reviewing my camera footage i probably shouldn't of invited steve and larry. <eos> apparently the nurses were having way too much fun too. <eos> maybe the brunette was the one who brought the absinthe. <eos> looks like i had a great time, i hope the patient did too.
the first to arrive to the gore party. <eos> its halloween and these two made a great pair. <eos> she surprised the camera with a blood strewn smile. <eos> they look at the couple covered in blood. <eos> the couple, drenched in blood pose for a moment.
the party had many scary costumes <eos> including criminal ones. <eos> there were nurses of all kinds <eos> and they took many photos <eos> and even kissed each other.
bryan loves to throw movie parties.  <eos> tonight they are going to watch a classic from disney, the love bug.  <eos> zack got tired early and decided to take a nap.  <eos> terry is really getting into the movie because he's never seen it before.  <eos> shirley had too much to drink at the party so after everyone left bryan set her up on the couch for the night.
they stayed up late watching television.  <eos> jake was exhausted.  <eos> mike couldn't remember being so tired.  <eos> phillip was just glad exams were finally over.  <eos> tasha slept on the sofa. 
we really had a nice time at the party, but we were all so tired. <eos> here is james, he was the smart one, he just dropped on the first chair and covered his face and was out like a light. <eos> brad had to sit for a while before he could fall asleep, his ears were still ringing from all the loud noises. <eos> steve was the only one who wasn't tired and he wouldn't shut up so the rest could sleep. <eos> his wife helen must be used to his talking cause she was out as fast as james was. they also had the best places to sleep too.
the guy friends decided to please their one girl friend and put on a disney movie for movie night. <eos> mike hated it. he couldn't stand how girly disney is, so he hid in his t-shirt. <eos> luke was also distressed over this choice of movie and it was obvious in his body language. <eos> marco was pretty indifferent to what they watched, but he was a go with the flow kinda guy. <eos> as soon as the movie started, their girl friend fell asleep and they were all super mad that they had to suffer through that awful movie for nothing. 
the friends got together to have a movies night. <eos> they decided on a disney movie. <eos> not all the friends wanted to have their picture taken. <eos> then the movie started and they sat to watch it. <eos> after that some of them fell asleep.
it was graduation time <eos> many waited patiently for their named to be called <eos> finally the time had come at last <eos> many parents and family members were proud of their kids <eos> and some celebrated with a few drinks
graduation was finally here. <eos> we are so proud of her. <eos> the family was all there. <eos> the rest of the family showed up. <eos> we celebrated with drinks.
the hall where my sister graduated was beautiful.  <eos> the wait for the procession to start was tiring.  <eos> finally, it started. the graduates looked so happy. <eos>  after, my sister took a picture with her classmates.  <eos> we took her to a restaurant after and she played coy. 
the graduates were all lined up, ready to finally be done with school. <eos> as they walked across the stage, the president of the university handed them their diplomas. finally, they were done. <eos> after the ceremony, the graduates ran to find their families <eos> so that they could take pictures with them. <eos> then, most of them went out to dinner to celebrate their accomplishments. 
the girl was so excited to finally be able to graduate. <eos> then we walked across the stage to receive her diploma. <eos> her family was there to celebrate with her. <eos> they all stopped to take pictures to remember this day. <eos> after that they all sat down to have dinner.
we had our family over for dinner last night. <eos> the whole family was there and we were so happy to see each other. <eos> we had really good food! <eos> at the end of the night we all went out for a walk. <eos> it was a great night and we can't wait to do it again!
my mom can be annoying sometimes. <eos> yesterday she went around taking extreme closeups of people. <eos> dad was annoyed. <eos> my older brother was annoyed. <eos> my little brother's annoyance is obvious.
the man and the woman are sitting at the table. <eos> the people are drinking and eating food. <eos> the pastries are dusted with sugar. <eos> the man and the woman are outside of a building. <eos> the man and woman pose for a photo.
once a month they get together for a taste testing of the newest creation by jean. <eos> she invites the whole family over to get everyone's opinion. <eos> this time it's donut holes on the menu. <eos> the evening was a great success. <eos> jean and her partner can't wait until the next one.
the young couple sat down to have a dinner with family. <eos> they had a large meal. <eos> then they all enjoyed desert. <eos> after that they went out for a night on the town. <eos> the couple had such a fun time.
there was a lot of people at the bar party. <eos> we played many games together. <eos> we had a great time with everybody. <eos> some people were underage. <eos> afterward we all went home when it was over.
this is the newest night club in town. complete with big screens to show video. <eos> it was painted in very dark colors and had odd furniture. <eos> i was amazed that there was a limbo. <eos> the dance space was a pretty good size. <eos> i think it might be fun for awhile.
there was a variety of drinks at the venue. <eos> this man in all white was full of energy and dance moves. <eos> the party got crazy and there were many people. <eos> i brought my friend along to share drinks with us. <eos> the screen contained a blue sky and clouds.
the concert was wild and went on into the night. <eos> some people got so drunk they passed out. <eos> my brother showed the crowd his attempt at the limbo. <eos> many people found themselves dancing alone. <eos> the brinkley sisters watched the fun most of the night but rarely joined in.
one of the big events of the college year is the limbo party at the big frat. i was there ready to defend my title. <eos> however, i got beaten right away by edwardo. <eos> i had a great time anyway. there was a huge crowd. <eos> some of these kids didn't really look old enough to drink to me, though! <eos> i loved the cloud projections on the wall. when you are intoxicated, they are something else to see.
the nightclub was filled to capacity. <eos> the band took the stage and started to play. <eos> there was a balcony overlooking the crowd. <eos> the band started playing their favorite song. <eos> a view to the balcony before the night ended. 
i went to a club the other night. boy, was it crowded! <eos> i went upstairs and took pictures of the people. <eos> the band was upstairs too. they played songs for the crowd. <eos> we danced and waved to our friends. <eos> everyone had a good time.
our band was playing our first sold out show and we managed to get the venue packed to the wall. <eos> todd has been trying to experiment with some new guitar riffs for a bigger sound. <eos> we played on a platform that the audience could walk under. <eos> we always try to bring as much passion as we can to our music to make it worth our fan's while. <eos> the lighting effects we could get at this bar were incredible.
there was a lot of people at the concert venue. <eos> here are a man and woman posing for the camera above. <eos> the band played awesome music for the people. <eos> these three men were having a great time at the concert. <eos> a picture of the people enjoying the concert.
the club had many people show up <eos> to see the guy play guitar. <eos> there were even curious people  <eos> and people that would sing. <eos> there was a bridge for people to stand on as well.
family and friends gathered at the restaurant for the celebration.  <eos> a platter of drinks arrived.  <eos> one of us didn't hesitate to jump right in.  <eos> he's always a good story teller after a few drinks.  <eos> sometimes he will get up to act it out. we left shortly after. 
at the pub and about to start drinking. <eos> the tray of shots are ready to be drank. <eos> taking the first shot of the night. <eos> cleansing the palate after the first shot. <eos> everything is much funnier after a few shots.
there were many people relaxing in the living room. <eos> there were many shots and drinks set up. <eos> my friends began to take drinks in order. <eos> my best friend was the real tanker. he took four shots. <eos> he said the room was spinning and it was obviously not spinning.
he had to take birthday shots. <eos> lots of alcohol was on the plate. <eos> he started off with his first shot. <eos> later, he reached for the tequila. <eos> later on, he really started to feel the effects of alcohol.
everyone got together for drinks and conversation. <eos> there were cocktails and shots available. <eos> tom got a head start and downed 3 shots in a row. <eos> he was pretty toasty after that. <eos> he stood up to see if he could walk a straight line.
jeremy was in deep thought waiting for the st. patrick's party to start. <eos> the guys were doing last minute work on the tarp. <eos> when the party started though it was fun, and here's jarod posing for a pic. <eos> sam and his boyfriend kyle enjoyed themselves too. <eos> later on, kenneth got a little sleepy though.
the party was coming to an end. <eos> they had a lot to clean up. <eos> the roof had to be cover from damage. <eos> they needed to get it covered before the rain came. <eos> they damaged the carpet from the party.
today was the day that i could be a leprechaun. <eos> we started to set up for the party. <eos> my friend has his st. patty attire on. <eos> we definitely needed a break after the hard work. <eos> today was definitely exhausting but we got everything together. what a day!
i decided to spend st. patrick's day with a few friends. <eos> we set up a tarp to protect us from rain while we hung out outside.  <eos> trevor thought he looked really good in a green hat. <eos> friendships were kindled that day. <eos> isaac said he had the best time of his life and then he went home to hibernate. 
the guy with the green hat was thinking <eos> before going outside  <eos> and then seeing another guy in a green hat  <eos> to take a photo with. <eos> the guy had a nice day overall.
lacy and her friend had a night out on the town. <eos> they met a lot of friendly people and took pictures with some of them. <eos> they went to various different hot spots and partied the night away. <eos> lacy came across her one of her other friends who was also out on the town. <eos> at the end of the night they were exhausted but they also had lots of fun.
jasmine and some of her friends went on a bunch of blind dates on week. <eos> jasmine's first day was very unattractive but incredibly funny. <eos> clara's blind date looked like an anorexic serial killer. <eos> sarah's date had social anxiety and wouldn't leave his house. <eos> monique's blind date was a down to earth guy, and she would eventually marry him.
the singles mingle was a great time. we met people from all over, of all different ethnicities. <eos> some of the guys were creepy but we smiled and bore with it. <eos> a few people hooked up pretty fast. <eos> i met my current boyfriend there. <eos> my friend met hers too.
my friends and i went to a club. <eos> we all get together some time for a good time. <eos> there were lots of people at the club. <eos> we all danced and sang with the music. <eos> at the end of the night, we all had had fun.
the friends got together for a night out. <eos> they met new friends while they were having fun. <eos> then they got to know the rest of the people there. <eos> some of the them danced on the dance floor. <eos> at the end of the night they had made so many new friends.
i decided to have a summer bbq. <eos> i invited a few of my friends over. <eos> we ate great food and had a couple of drinks. <eos> we hung out late into the the night. <eos> apparently some of us had to much fun and passed out early.
jimmy had a cookout with all of his friends. <eos> they had everything you can think of cooking on the grill. <eos> jimmy met a nice young lady named samantha at the cookout. <eos> jimmy's cousin sal and his girlfriend had to leave early. <eos> after everyone ate they hung out by the pool for the rest of the evening.
dave's barbecuing in his brick oven. he loves this kind of thing. <eos> we're happy to let him cook. i'll just chill here with a bottle of whatever the heck this is with my girl.  <eos> well, i can honestly say i have no idea what auntie jo is mixing up. looks like mark is brave enough to give it a try. better him than me.  <eos> it's hours later and we've been looking for mark for ever. i don't know what was in that muck he ate but he flipped out and took off running towards the beach in the dark. <eos> oh good lord, skippy the wonder dog has sniffed him out. he's still alive at least but he's a really funny color. no more eating auntie jo's food buddy.
the grill was fired up and ready. <eos> it was a great day for a party. <eos> potato salad was just one of the delicious treats! <eos> by the time night fell, they were ready to relax in the sand. <eos> even the dog came out to have a little party time of his own.
my place was pretty awesome for having barbecues. <eos> cindy smiled as she sat next to craig. <eos> the food was abundant and spectacular. <eos> greg advanced toward cindy toward the end of the night. <eos> he ended up being best friends with the dog instead. 
the group had a great night out at the brewery restaurant. <eos> they ordered sausages and other food to go with their beer. <eos> kim loved her brew. <eos> tom and margaret took big gulps from theirs too. <eos> later they all left, full and happy.
we decided to go out to dinner at the t.y. harbor brewery. <eos> the first beer i got was a little light but it was great. <eos> the food i got to wash it down was a hot dog. <eos> we then tried a few more dark beers and they were awesome. <eos> after our dinner we went outside and enjoyed the atmosphere.
heather went to a fancy winery for a fun night out. <eos> she ordered a dish that she has never tried before. <eos> alcohol helps her relax when talking to friends. <eos> her friends thought the same thing about her.  <eos> as heather left the winery, she appreciated the great times she had there. 
this is the best place to eat <eos> i had my usual.  <eos> here grace sending us peace. <eos> jan and art are enjoying their dark beers. <eos> after we head out to enjoy the night sky.
the restaurant was lit up well <eos> and served good food. <eos> there was beer as well <eos> that the couple enjoyed <eos> while looking at the nice flowers.
we began our day on a platform in the lake. <eos> some of my friends decided to dive off and swim. <eos> the bridge led us to a wonderful and secluded spot. <eos> i took a picture with my wife and the spot. <eos> we also headed back and relaxed a bit before the sun went down.
the lake is a perfect summer destination. <eos> there are a lot of fun activities to do at the lake. <eos> you can sunbathe on the rocks and floating dock. <eos> you can even dive and swim in the cool, clear water. <eos> it's a great place to come with friends and family.
it's a beautiful day at lake tahoe. the waters are emerald green and the sun is shining. <eos> this is the summer house we've rented. it's in a stunning location and we're ready for fun. <eos> the day is hot but the water is ice cold as always. not everyone is brave enough to dive in. <eos> of course a few beers helps with the courage.  <eos> the smart ones stay back and watch the foolhardy jumping into the icy water. 
the day of our family vacation finally arrived. <eos> we made out way down to the lake after leaving our belongings int eh lodge. <eos> there were a lot of other people out on the river. <eos> they really looked like they were having fun as well. <eos> after a good swim we headed back to the lodge to relax.
we spent the weekend at the lake. <eos> first we went swimming from the dock. diving and swimming. <eos> we stayed in our family cabin.  <eos> the views from the shore are beautiful. <eos> we spent the evenings relaxing and enjoying the great outdoors.
a group of friends went to see one of the most popular djs in the world. <eos> they watched him in awe. <eos> they made comments about his work, and he overheard. <eos> he invited them in for a group picture. <eos> he was actually much friendlier and sillier than they thought!
everyone showed up for the party at the club. <eos> the dj was definitely the life of the party. <eos> he was also very good at his musical job. <eos> the night was danced away by the crowd. <eos> even some kids came out before the night was over.
this is jake. <eos> he is the best dj in the k'ville area! <eos> everyone asks him to come and dj their events. <eos> everyone has amazing fun with jake! <eos> and at times, he gets a little wild and crazy!
this dj sometimes overshadows the music with his antics. <eos> even though he has a crazy personality, he has critically acclaimed musical taste. <eos> it's hard not to laugh at the things this grown man does. <eos> everyone loves to get their picture taken with the craziest dj in town. <eos> but sometimes he isn't always appropriate for the whole family.
this group is practicing for the big concert. <eos> they women with white glasses is presenting herself by having a good time. <eos> this band member practicing his keyboard performance.  <eos> this band member also practicing for the concert.  <eos> this band member presenting is two son, both dress in red and blue.
rachel and bo decided to have a big 4th of july party.  <eos> they invited all of their closest friends to the party, including steven. <eos> towards the end of the night everyone found a good spot on the grass to watch the fireworks.  <eos> the fireworks were very beautiful that night.  <eos> at the end of the night, everyone was tired including buster their dog. 
i love sitting on the grass and watching fireworks on the 4th of july.  <eos> the blue swirly one has always been one of my favorites.  <eos> my dog, boomer, didn't like it so much.  <eos> but it did get lisa's attention inside the house where she had gone to get a snack.  <eos> she got back just in time to watch the rest of the pyrotechnic show with me. it was a very happy independence day. 
we watched the fireworks this year under a blue light. this way there was less glare. <eos> some of the fireworks were blue too. <eos> my dog felt lonely since he wasn't the center of attention and so he just laid down by our side the entire night. <eos> my girlfriend was pretty busy running around getting things and food. <eos> she took some time out from all her duties though and was able to enjoy some of the show with me.
i spent the fourth with my boyfriend and his family! <eos> we both agreed to leave early to get to the fireworks show before everyone else. <eos> we laid out blankets on the ground, so we'd have somewhere to sit and watch the show. <eos> the fireworks show was awesome! <eos> even the dog was excited about the celebration.
the group of friends had a night together to fun. <eos> everyone was so happy to see each other. <eos> then they sat outside for the night. <eos> the camera settings were off and captured some strange photos. <eos> even the dog joined them outside.
i had to finish the construction project as fast as possible. <eos> the deadline was next week. <eos> i still had to do all of the electrical. <eos> i called some people to help me. <eos> the place was packed and we finished it up by the end of the week.
we were putting together the last last month. <eos> the finished product looked really amazing. <eos> we even had refreshments for everyone working on it. <eos> it was really hard work but we all helped each other out. <eos> with our team work we were able to out together something really amazing.
the set for the new community show started off slowly. <eos> it took awhile build because they couldn't decide exactly how to portray the rooms. <eos> it was great though because the set was catered with sandwiches everyday. <eos> they even used brick in some places to make it look more believable. <eos> that was also another reason why it took longer than usual to build.
the construction scene was surprisingly clean. <eos> the workers didn't like mess, so they made sure to clean up every night. <eos> they had tables set up for them to eat lunch on, <eos> and then they got back to work <eos> constructing the new building. 
the workers are working on renovating a building. <eos> they worked on building the walls and the carpet. <eos> then they worked on the individual offices. <eos> after that they finished the tile floors. <eos> once they were done the crowd of people was there to celebrate the completion. 
went to the public market, let's see what we can find today?  <eos> parking was so easy, can't believe there weren't more cars here.  <eos> fresh food, i'm sold.  <eos> they have some of the freshest crab in town, i'll take 2 please.  <eos> there were tons of people there and long lines for samples. 
three senior students took a cruise of the bay. <eos> after the cruise one of the student went market shopping. <eos> all three students are taking a bus tour viewing the scene. <eos> all three students are being presented with metal for outstanding performance. <eos> before returning home, the students are having a conversation.
we walked on the boardwalk in our way to the tech convention.  <eos> we passed a street market that was loaded with amazing looking fresh vegetables.  <eos> we had to take a tram once we got on campus.  <eos> we saw a robot demo that was really cool at the convention.  <eos> outside, we met some guys who worked in our field and sat to talk with them a bit about our projects. 
i love taking trips to the market. <eos> its a bit of a drive but well worth it. <eos> they have fresh vegetables and fruit all week. <eos> as well as plenty of fish and meat. <eos> the best part has to be the people though.
the market was having a huge sale today, <eos> so the workers expected a lot of people to drive by. <eos> before they opened, they set out all of their produce, <eos> and made sure there were signs explaining how the sale worked. <eos> finally, people started showing up, and the sale was a great hit. 
at last it was time for paint party 2005. <eos> ivan draw outlines of some creatures to paint on the otherwise boring wall. <eos> unicorns made an appearance among the other mythical creatures that began to grace the walls that day. <eos> even the toilet became part of the art. <eos> afterward, there was a well deserved rest for all.
does anyone know an interior designeer  <eos> to take this blank slate  <eos> and make something beautiful  <eos> it's hard work to make design work of a wall  <eos> umm this is not what i was looking for 
mike pointed out a spot on the wall <eos> that was completely empty. he decided it was too empty <eos> and needed to be drawn on. so he found some art supplies and drew a unicorn. <eos> martha joined in and started drawing cool designs on the wall. <eos> their other friend, lyle, was just being crazy though, and his artwork was to nail a toilet seat to the wall and draw a fish in the middle. it was really funny, but not very practical. overall, though, they had fun decorating the walls. 
everyone decided to throw a paint party. <eos> first they drew doodles on the walls. <eos> then they painted them in. <eos> after that they hung up decorations to go with the paintings. <eos> at the end of the day, everyone was ready for a break.
the chalkboard was written on <eos> before the guy started drawing. <eos> he draw a big unicorn <eos> and a fish in a toilet <eos> and his wife was impressed.
it was a day for the musicians to get together. <eos> they started to slowly show up and they brought their own instruments. <eos> everyone always loves to sing that song. <eos> finally the electric guitarist showed up. <eos> one last jam session before the day is through.
my music buddies and i are having a jam session. <eos> larry plays a sassy sax. <eos> jen rips the accordion licks.  <eos> i love guitar and am working the chords. <eos> pete really gets into the keyboards and keeps the music tempo.
seth performed a wonderful saxophone solo at the start of the jam session.  <eos> a couple of people brought their own instruments and attempted to play them. <eos> an amateur pianist started to play the entertainer and got a good reception. <eos> juan brought his guitar and began to wail on it. <eos> the other musicians started their own jam session and moved to the garage shortly after. 
there are many musicians at the party. <eos> people are playing guitar <eos> and piano <eos> and electric guitar. <eos> the band is all playing together.
the mighty raccoons brass band had not seen in each other in years before they reunited. <eos> teddy 'bad sax' molinski was ready to go. <eos> terry 'motor mouth' crews arrived with a hot harmonica that needed playing. <eos> bobby 'stinky finger' jones was rocking the second he showed up. <eos> the band was all there, and played there forgotten hits alone, and together, throughout the night.
the day started with a beer and the pipe. <eos> my cousin went outside to look the animals. <eos> that night, we staged a huge campfire. <eos> my sister brought her blanket along with her. <eos> before the night was over, my brother went to sleep early.
the beach party was crazy. <eos> we had a huge fire going. <eos> we sat around telling stories. <eos> we also brought some drinks with us. <eos> afterward we were very sleepy.
we decided to go camping and dad was all up for it. <eos> there were animals in the wilderness where we decided to settle. <eos> we built a camp fire and the fire lit up high. <eos> still, it was super chilly. <eos> but i still slept like a pig that night and didn't want to wake when the sun was high and bright.
the men set up a large bonfire. <eos> they use an old bedfrme to get it started. <eos> a woman leans in towards the fire to warm up. <eos> friends talk about old memories through the evening. <eos> a girl falls asleep after a long night.
papa joe sat around puffing on a cigar and drinking a can of beer. <eos> the guys waited outside for it to get dark. <eos> it was time for a bonfire. <eos> it was chilly that evening, great weather to be wrapped in a cozy blanket. <eos> such a late night made everyone rather sleepy.
i was quite concerned when i was at the amusement park and people in bio chemical suits began to show up. i worried there was a virus outbreak. <eos> i noticed that staff members met with them and escorted them into the auditorium. <eos> they were followed by company executives. it turned out it was a seminar as to how to keep guests safe in case of a breakout. <eos> afterwards, they spend some time answering questions for the park's guests. <eos> they even posed for pictures. i was so glad there was nothing wrong.
there was an exercise in the city today  <eos> people in hazmat suits walked around to raise awareness  <eos> they were telling people about potential hazardous waste <eos> they really caught the attention of the fat cats <eos> the big business people couldnt get into their building 
there was an out break last week. <eos> me and my team where sent to take a look at what we could do. <eos> we meet with some suits before we went in. <eos> after we found nothing we went and talked to the locals. <eos> some of them even wanted to take pictures.
dressed in hazard gear, they hoped to make an impact on the community. <eos> armed with flyers, they were determined to make a difference. <eos> many people stopped and listened to what they had to say. <eos> others were hesitant, wanting to get away as quickly as possible. <eos> in the end, it seemed that they had done some good for their cause.
a group of people protested in costumes. <eos> they waited on the street for people to pass by. <eos> then they would hand fliers to people that would pass by. <eos> after that they walked down the street to find more people. <eos> they stopped a couple of men as they were walking inside the building.
we took cool looking train into the city. <eos> we went to a beautiful park downtown. <eos> the views from the park were breathtaking. <eos> we went to a spa to relax after the park. <eos> followed by an amazing sushi dinner to top off a great day.
this is a new rocket subway being installed in canada.  <eos> it's built underground to keep from disturbing roads already in place.  <eos> the stations run for several blocks each.  <eos> in just a few months this area will be full of passengers.  <eos> this is a smaller eraly morning commuter version pulling in. 
the subway was extremely fast and efficient. <eos> when we got off, we headed through the entrance to the spa. <eos> these was a longer journey than we thought to the spa. <eos> when we got there, there was only one person in the tub. <eos> we had a lot of delicious food at the spa.
it's new bullet train. we call it donald because of the nose which looks like a duck bill. <eos> today is testing day for this new train. the station is empty because it's not ready for the public yet. <eos> the tracks are clear too. we don't want anything getting in the way of the test. <eos> it's weird to see the place so empty. like a zombie apocalypse emptied the place of humanity. <eos> okay, and we're off. the test ride has begun.
asian subways always impress me. <eos> the floors are so clean i would eat off them. <eos> couldnt say that about american subways. <eos> its odd to see them deserted, usally they are packed. <eos> i would take this to work every day if i could 
we decorated the christmas tree for the holiday party.  <eos> our cat, fluffy, climbed up a small tree, and wouldn't come back to the house.  <eos> my friend and i baked brownies for the party.  <eos> my brother-in-law, and his son, david, getting ready for dinner.  <eos> the pie we bought from walmart was very delicious.
christmas is my favorite time of year. <eos> we all gathered together to celebrate. <eos> uncle fez was memorialized with the planting of his tree. <eos> ben was sad. <eos> we ate peanut butter brownies in his memory.
it was christmas eve and all was quiet  <eos> not a soul around <eos> only jacob outside he found a new friend <eos> and the two got to know each other <eos> and this was left for santa that night 
christmas is the best time of the year, <eos> even if it doesn't snow where this family is. <eos> they still love their christmas treats <eos> and hanging out with their family. <eos> but best of all, the christmas treats.
i love sitting by the fireplace, looking at the christmas tree. <eos> frisky must not enjoy all the holiday company because he was outside in the tree. <eos> grandma always makes her special brownie cakes for christmas. <eos> my niece and my brother in law spent a lot of quality time together.  <eos> the butter pecan pie never seems to last in this house.
the amount of pictures to view from the cruise was overwhelming. <eos> all of the signs there looked like this. <eos> here is the view as we approached the city on our boat. <eos> here we are leaving the harbor to go snorkeling. <eos> i received the package from the trip today, everything seems to be in order.
shopping in a foreign country is always exiting. <eos> walking around the city to get a feel for where we are. <eos> the street signs are a little confusing. <eos> relaxing by the water and taking a rest. <eos> at the marina watching the boats come and go.
after we had spent our day in the market we decided to go for a short walk. <eos> there were a lot of apartment buildings on top of the shops in the market area. <eos> we had trouble deciding where we want to go. <eos> we eventually found the dock and spent some time there. <eos> after hanging out for a few minutes we decided to head home.
a foreign country is always fun to visit. <eos> i couldn't read most of the text. <eos> the lake had a lot of fish jumping in it. <eos> the boats sat there quietly. <eos> i received a nice package when i got back home. 
on out trip we stopped to see the local stores. <eos> navigating was rough because we didn't understand the language. <eos> we headed to the river to admire the view. <eos> there were plenty of boats available for rent. <eos> we bought gifts for those back at home.
sarah always throws the best parties.  <eos> this is the glass she always uses at her parties.  <eos> this year's theme was a toga party.  <eos> she picked a colorful toga. <eos> as usual, the crazy party antics ensued. 
we are acting like romans. <eos> the wine from the vine is going down fine. <eos> this bite is a all about the grapes! <eos> check out my headband. whoa! <eos> they look like royalty and seem to enjoy it.

my friends and i threw an awesome toga party last night. <eos> loud music, cool glasses to a lot more in between. it was a good time had by all. <eos> my closest friends were able to make it out. <eos> i was trying to be serious in some of the photos, but i busted out laughing afterwards. <eos> my friends sure are a crazy bunch, but i wouldn't have it any other way.

i had a great time on vacation last year.  <eos> i went to see a festival in the street. <eos> there were many performers. <eos> they were all carrying some sort of structure. <eos> it was very impressive.
steve, tim and matt decided to a bros only trip to asia.  <eos> they chose a time of year that had many festivities.  <eos> during the festivities they got really drunk.  <eos> they tried to get into the parade and carry a special float.  <eos> at the end of the parade they decided to buy drinks for some of the locals. 
we were asked to join in the local parade in japan. they gave us some robes we could wear and keep. <eos> as we prepared, the streets filled up with people. <eos> we chatted and got to know each other as we waited for it to start. <eos> our role was to carry a palanquin through the streets. <eos> afterwards, we celebrated with some drinks and watched the rest of the parade.
people crowded around to watch the parade. <eos> one float in particular, caught everyone's attention. <eos> they ran over to it to see what was going on and to take pictures. <eos> it got so bad that people had to start pushing others out of the way <eos> just to get a look at it. 
the friends arrived to the japanese parade. <eos> they saw some interesting floats pass by. <eos> they watched with excitement. <eos> then they got involved with the festivities. <eos> after that they sat down to have a few drinks.
today we are celebrating are love for each other, so we went out to eat. <eos> the couple was goofing off but was so happy. <eos> this couple is just too in love but are really cute together. <eos> we moved to the other side to hang out and drink a little bit. <eos> finally back home with my mom. we had fun.
julie and sandy were celebrating at the pub.  <eos> they invited all of their friends.  <eos> we waited for our food to come.  <eos> after a few drinks things got lively.  <eos> by the end of the night many of us were a little tipsy. 
it was going to be a bad night. <eos> some no brain thought it was going to be a good idea to play truth and dare in a restaurant. <eos> dont know why they thought this was going to be a good idea. <eos> after a bit most of the group split up and got their own table. <eos> me and charlie just went home.
my friends and i decided to go out and celebrate pride day with each other. <eos> my brother and his partner started off the night with some public displays of affection. <eos> my brother gave me the idea to lay a kiss on my wife. <eos> we all hung out at the bar a little while longer, talking about the day so far. <eos> after the bar we came home. my brother and i ended the knight with some family bonding.
today kim and stephanie celebrated their engagement. <eos> all their friends and family members attended. <eos> they went to a nice restaurant where kim and stephanie first met. <eos> it was a little awkward at first but after a few drinks the table became lively. <eos> the entire restaurant could hear how much of a good time they were having.
bonnie's closest friends tim and tammy threw her a surprise birthday party.  <eos> bonnie loved opening her gifts.  <eos> bonnie's favorite gift was from john.  <eos> even bonnie's sisters came to the party.  <eos> bonnie was able to thank john later in the evening for her fabulous gift.

at the charity event, there were many paintings up done by local atrists. <eos> one area had fun events, such as a hula-hoop competition. <eos> the speakers were very interesting and their testimony was very deep and heartwarming. <eos> i was shocked at the huge size of the crowd. <eos> the finale act was worth waiting for. everyone was singing and dancing the entire afternoon.
a crowd gathered to wait for the concert. <eos> some fans decided to have fun while they waited. <eos> finally, a speaker introduced the main event. <eos> the crowd looked on in anticipation. <eos> the people went wild when they show finally started.

"he looked on at the sign emblazoned with ""this is war"" and contemplated how true the statement was.  <eos> one of the festival goers picked up a rainbow hoola hoop and attempted to beat the record.  <eos> the woman stepped up the microphone and began to rally the crowd.  <eos> the festival goers looked on, and their forms stretched almost as far as the road itself.  <eos> "one of the musicians held up a fist and pumped up the crowd before blazing into a guitar solo. 
my two friends, rachael and rebecca, laughing at my story.  <eos> rachael observing the couples dancing in slow motion. <eos> my brother, rick, trying to tell me to stay away from where he was going. <eos> rick's classmate, john, trying to do a monster impression. <eos> the dj was playing music after music while the crowd cheered.

the girls were excited to go to the club tonight. <eos> they had a great time dancing <eos> with most of the guys. <eos> some of the weird guys, not so much, <eos> but overall they had an amazing night and the dj was awesome.
my friend and i were excited to arrive at the venue for a fun night of experimental music.  <eos> a man dressed in a tuxedo met us as we walked in and led us to our seats.  <eos> on the way, we passed a man with a mask who reminded us to take water with us.  <eos> the view of the sound system from our seats was pretty interesting.  <eos> at one point we even got to go backstage for a close up view of the instruments and a view of the audience. 
the girls are laughing at the party <eos> and also enjoying drinks. <eos> the guy is singing <eos> and the dj is being scary <eos> while everyone dances to the music.
these young people have decided to have an evening centered on drinking beer. <eos> the solo cups are filled. <eos> the party goers lift the cups to their lips. <eos> dave shows off his ability to guzzle from a hose. <eos> sue tries to match dave, but females have less alcohol metabolizing capability than males, so she will so pass out.
the group of friends gathered for a drinking party. <eos> carter wasn't happy to be there. <eos> fred wasn't impressed by carter's display. <eos> jermaine thought he'd won the chugging game. <eos> but sarah won it with her mighty chug.
i will put the beer in this jug to pour in the hose that we will use.  <eos> i am putting my middle finger up to everyone who thinks i a punk for punking out.  <eos> that is really mature of you to do that.  <eos> i will be first to drink down the beer.  <eos> i will beat his time for drinking down his beer. 
the group of friends decided to play a drinking game, <eos> they got their cups, <eos> and they started filling them up. <eos> joe got the funnel out <eos> and then he got his wife to try it. it was a great night filled with alcohol and laughs. 
the party includes many drinks <eos> and some not happy guys. <eos> the friend isn't happy either <eos> to see the binge drinking although <eos> the girl tries it too.
the college students gathered for a party. <eos> gary played the guitar. <eos> then steve took over on banjo. <eos> darth vader made an appearance. <eos> chris played video games as the party wrapped up.
on the night of the party everyone was so excited to see each other. <eos> a few of the guys broke out the guitar and started to play some tunes. <eos> my friend james got a photo standing next to his favorite character darth vader. <eos> for most of the night we decided to play retro video games. <eos> the gun i used while playing the nintendo game dunk hunt.
i thought i was going to a cool party but it was full of nerds. <eos> i thought i would make the best of it and busted out the guitar. <eos> i was informed darth vader disapproved. <eos> they then went back to gaming. <eos> i decided if they wanted to treat the gaming like real life it was time to step it up a notch.....game on. pew!!
we had our gamer party today. <eos> we had a good time and even played music. <eos> we even had a special guest! <eos> we played many old school games together. <eos> this little guy that brought us such good memories gave us even more today!

i was so happy to be heading to the concert.  <eos> my friend was excited to be with me.  <eos> the huge crowd was out of control by the time we got there.  <eos> we moved closer to the stage during the show.  <eos> the lights and projection screens were very interesting.

i went to a little aquatic zoo today. <eos> the first thing i saw was this huge turtle. <eos> this gecko wasn't part of the aquarium but i saw it walking around. <eos> they even had various seafood around to feed the bigger aquatic mammals. <eos> i managed to get this souvenir turtle!
patty decided to go out to buy a new turtle for a friend. <eos> her friend anna was the local owner and knew just what to look for. <eos> along the way she met up with her friend john who was having a walk on the beach. <eos> she wondered if she could find any turtles around here. <eos> after her trip she opened the box to show her friend her new turtle while they were out to eat.
it was time for a pet turtle. <eos> this is how big they can get. <eos> ooops i almost stepped on gecky! <eos> they were going to feed him to these animals! <eos> i choose this turtle, i think i will call him pikachu!
the turtles stayed at the reptile house. <eos> this turtle was named jerry. <eos> he was friends with this salamander. <eos> they both didn't want to be used as bait. <eos> they wanted to be sold to a nice person who would let them be alive. 
we went to the wildlife refuge today. <eos> we saw a giant turtle. <eos> we also saw a tiny lizard. <eos> we took a bunch of fish and one lobster home. <eos> but i brought home the most beautiful turtle i have ever seen.

"she has the look like this will be a long party. <eos> they light the minora and get on with it. <eos> he has a look of ""i don't want to be here"" <eos> the cookies look delightful and delicious. <eos> "she eases the mood with a stiff drink.
janie wanted to have a candle party. <eos> many came to look at all the candles she makes. <eos> she showed us all how she started them. <eos> she had lots of tealight type candles. <eos> and many pretty holders she makes as well.
my new girlfriend is jewish and from this point forward i celebrate holidays with her.  <eos> the only symbol of judiasm that i'm familiar with is the menorah. <eos> some of her jewish friends didn't really think that i fit in. <eos> maybe they were right because i did not enjoy their food. <eos> the only way to get through the day was to drink lots of alcohol.
the first guests began to arrive for the hanukkah celebration.  <eos> the candle shone brightly and the long table was set when the guests began to fill it. <eos> each attendee shared their thanks for the hosts and began to wait for the food to arrive. <eos> when it did everyone commented on the unusual foods and how interesting it looked.  <eos> whatever apprehensions hey had was quickly forgotten as the guests began to dig in. 
the live music was impressive. <eos> the girl liked the music so much she gave a kiss. <eos> the boys are having fun. <eos> this girl likes the music. <eos> the girl nows how to lay down some pain.
"my first party in the dorm!  <eos> there was a very loud band called ""very loud band."" <eos> my friend melissa had enough. she took my hand and led me to the kitchen where we could hear.  <eos> bobby and jack cornered me and asked me out on a date with them both. i freaked out and ran into the hallway.  <eos> "party! they screamed. we all danced until passed out. 
we went to see my friend's band. <eos> i ran into an old friend! <eos> we were all joking around. <eos> i called my other friends to tell them he was here. <eos> we all had a fun night.
stacy is so happy. today is her birthday and everyone is at her house to celebrate it! <eos> joel and pablo even convinced their band to show up and sing stacy's favorite rock songs. <eos> jill is having such a great time she decides to call over even more people. <eos> jack and ronald just arrived only five minutes ago and they are already having a blast. <eos> at the end of the night stacy and all her friends get together and take silly birthday photos.
the night of the party was very exciting and when the guests began to arrive they began to share their eagerness. <eos> there was even a live band playing, some local kids who had decided to stop by and entertain the crowd. <eos> some of the kids had to call their parents against the loud noise of the music, but most didn't seem to mind. <eos> there was fun to be had all around, especially when it came to being goofy and silly. <eos> the more the night wore on, the more the crowd began to lose all inhibitions. 
matza balls are cooking in preparation for the jewish celebration. <eos> some type of green bean vegetables are a compliment. <eos> some delicious meat will compliment the other foods. <eos> in honor of the jewish event we have a star of david garnish art. <eos> the girl has made a passover pillow to honor the traditions.

we had a big family dinner this week. <eos> everyone was hungry and eating really fast. <eos> the food was delicious and all got eaten. <eos> after dinner, we snacked on desserts. <eos> at the end we all posed for the group picture.
a dinner table was nicely set for six for a family meal. <eos> the diners seemed to have a nice, quiet time. <eos> one of the dishes was served in a fancy china dish with a gold ring. <eos> several kinds of desserts were placed on a platter. <eos> after dinner, five family members posed for a photo.
uncle bill prepared a feast for his family. <eos> bill's son was distracted by the baseball game on the tv. <eos> one of the best dishes was homemade chicken broth with dumplings. <eos> the plate of dessert treats disappeared in minutes. <eos> the family gathered together on the couch, full after a big meal.
my priest gave me a tour of the church today. i saw many things i hadn't noticed before. <eos> he showed me the ceiling and explained what the artwork represented in the tiles. <eos> the church is full of beautiful stained glass windows, and i loved looking at them all. <eos> this one shows adam and eve in the garden of eden. <eos> but, this one is my favorite window. it shows jonah being swallowed by the whale. it is scary and weird, something you don't think of seeing at church!
i got the opportunity to take a tour of a 16th century church. <eos> the church had huge stained glass panels that were amazing. <eos> the glass panels had many different depictions of scenes from the bible. <eos> i was amazed at the attention to detail in the panels. <eos> my favorite was the glass panel at the back of the church that took up the entire wall.
we took a tour of the old church. <eos> first there was the beautiful ceiling in the church. <eos> then we to a large stained glass portrait. <eos> after that we came to a portrait of adam and eve. <eos> finally we came to a picture of a man being swallowed by a beast.
priest looking at the ceiling of the church. <eos> mahogany ceiling with gold decor. <eos> window showing the life of jesus christ. <eos> adam and eve and satan. <eos> getting swallowed by a whale. 
we visited this famous historical church downtown today. <eos> the ceiling was almost 4 stories high! it was incredible! <eos> the window paintings were so intricate and beautiful. <eos> we sat there and just stared off into the distance at the art work. <eos> this one was kind of freaky for obvious reasons.
my friends and i formed a musical band last summer. <eos> here i'm playing the keyboard, but i don't think i'm very good at it. <eos> my friend, eric, sings music and is good with playing the guitar. <eos> we had to spend a lot of money on the equipment. <eos> we have to be careful around the wires when we walk, otherwise we'll trip and fall.
we acted like groupies before the band practiced their set. <eos> they set everything up and got started. <eos> moving and being showy is part of the process. <eos> they are concentrating on hitting the right notes. <eos> everyone sets up their drums differently and she is no exception.
we got some pictures with the lead vocalist before the show. <eos> we were at the front of the show. <eos> it was an amazing performance. <eos> i got some incredible pictures from where we were standing. <eos> just adjusting his sound settings.
the musicians take pictures with some fans before the performance. <eos> all their equipment is ready and she is playing the keys. <eos> the lead singer starts the song and the band plays together. <eos> the whole band can be seen performing. <eos> later in the night, another guitarist can be seen.
we came to a friend's concert for support and took pictures before his performance. <eos> our friend performed well on stage. <eos> he played a variety of instruments. <eos> his band also played well. <eos> there were some technical difficulties towards the end. 
everyone enjoyed the office christmas dinner. <eos> some people like to try and make you think they are grouchy. <eos> most people want to make sure they get a smile in a picture. <eos> they are all sated and content from the food. <eos> all christmas parties need songs!
our family dinner this evening. lots of wine flowing. <eos> here i am trying to figure out how to eat more without telling anyone. <eos> my brothers are just awesome. i miss when they are not around. <eos> here is our new christmas poem we all created together. <eos> this was an incredible party. glad to see everyone again.
the friends were having a party. <eos> there was good at the party. <eos> the friends took pictures. <eos> there were a lot of drinks. <eos> they even had carols. 
just a get together - everyone's so happy. <eos> some more than others. <eos> we're all photogenic people. <eos> candid shot. <eos> we liked to sing.
all these wonderful faces coming together makes me smile. <eos> time for someone to try smiling! <eos> these two are always cracking us up. <eos> our own little take on a classic carol. <eos> he somehow ends up looking rather thirsty.
i sat at the table waiting for everyone to finish making the food for me. <eos> i had my friend come and light some candles. <eos> they also made me some drinks. <eos> i did some reading while i waited. <eos> i was starving when they finally brought the food.
it is dinnertime at my house.  <eos> we have some chicken. <eos> there's some wine. <eos> there's even a great dessert. fresh strawberries and cake taste so good. <eos> dinner at my house is delicious!
my brother enjoying dinner at mom's house.  <eos> my sister is not shy when it comes to good food. save some for me please. <eos> my dad with a bottle of homemade red wine. red wine makes any meal taste better.  <eos> after dinner we had fresh cut strawberries with pound cake. <eos> it was nice to see my brother again. he can definitely put away some food.
the dinner banquet is starting off with the first guest. he waits his chance to eat. <eos> another eager gets takes a piece of meat to finally eat. <eos> the man looks at one of the drinks that they will consume. <eos> the desert is all ready to eat. there are strawberries. <eos> finally, he gets a chance to partake in the meal.
it was my son's birthday and prepared a feast for him. <eos> we performed a jewish prayer and ritual before we started eating. <eos> we blessed the food with a prayer we read out loud. <eos> the prayer was several pages. <eos> we then started to eat the food. 
we all went camping last night. <eos> we made some food while we were there. <eos> at night we stayed in our tent. <eos> in the morning we had to clean up. <eos> it took a while.
reading a magazine in his tent. <eos> waiting for his girlfriend to arrive. <eos> they are ready to go on a motorcycle ride. <eos> having fun with his girlfriend. <eos> listening to jokes while camping.
the friends took a picture outside of the tent. they were the first to get there. <eos> the girl was cooking some food. <eos> the three lazily watched. <eos> there other friend showed up the next day. <eos> she fanned the flames of te fire with a magazine.
we needed a couple distractions on our trip out. <eos> the motorcycle we rode out on. <eos> happy couple! <eos> another happy couple! <eos> night time - bed came soon after.
it was finally the weekend and the group of friends went camping. <eos> one of their favorite camping activities was grilling food on an open fire. <eos> the friends also loved to simply sit around and talk, forgetting about the normal routines of suburbia. <eos> at one point, they ran out of fuel for the fire and found a useless magazine they could burn. <eos> however, one of the male friends saw the magazine cover and thought twice. he thought he could utilize the magazine for other purposes.
when everyone arrived we all sat around the table. <eos> everyone was very hungry. <eos> we also had a kid that was hungry. <eos> we served the food. <eos> everyone really enjoyed it.
we had to join up several tables to fit the family. <eos> we all said grace before eating. <eos> the food was great, even the picky kids loved it. <eos> dad sat at the head of the table as usual. <eos> at the end of the meal, we all sat at the table sharing memories.
setting the tables nice and neat for the party. <eos> so wonderful that everyone could make it <eos> little one is finally getting a handle on feeding himself. <eos> this family encourages helping yourself! <eos> after dinner ruminations with the family. 
the adults sit eagerly awaiting the meal to come. <eos> on the other side, the baby seems to be resting however there is noise. <eos> the noise awakens the child and he wants to eat. <eos> a boy looks on at the adult while eating his own meal. <eos> at the other end of the table, the host serves food and everyones is happy.
getting out whole extended family together for one meal is a big production! <eos> everyone was ready for a great meal, with treats and delights from the diverse branches of our family. <eos> even the little kids found something yummy, although most were curious about why all these people were their family. <eos> the adults told stories and re-lived old time, and soon even the children knew all these people well. <eos> by the end, it was, as is every dinner, a time to clean up, but also a time to relax and enjoy the mellowness of the end of a good meal.
i went to my friend's party last night. <eos> there was a lot of food there. <eos> we sat on the balcony and talked for hours. <eos> we were very full. <eos> we stayed there until the early morning hours.
jack's fourth of july was kind of low key.  <eos> that's not to say the kids didn't have a good time, they did.  <eos> and the adults had fun too, just chilling out.  <eos> cammy and rhonda just set up in two chairs and hardly moved the whole night.  <eos> everyone had fun. even when billy flung some kind of weird red ball at me. 
the family gathered together for quality time. <eos> the children enjoyed out door activities. <eos> the adults like to gather and watch the children <eos> adults would reminisce over past times. <eos> they enjoyed making new memories.
old and young enjoying dessert. <eos> birthday parties are always the best. <eos> enjoying watching the children play. <eos> everyone gathered for all the sweet treats! <eos> too busy tucking in to smile for the camera!
my family and i got together for dinner. <eos> the children lit fireworks and played. <eos> the adults watched the children play. <eos> some of us just sat and talked with a couple of drinks. <eos> we took a group picture at the end. 
when the sun arose, i took a picture of this lake. <eos> my friends and i ventured to this spot to get more pictures. <eos> around noon, we visited the church to go to service. <eos> as a field trip, my ministry went to enjoy a waterfall. <eos> towards the end of the day, we went back to the nice hotel.
we crossed a river on the way to the church. <eos> on the other side of the river was a gazebo. <eos> we could see the church from the gazebo area. <eos> getting closer to the church we had to go through an iron gate. <eos> we made it to the church by 10:30.
i enjoyed looking at the blue lake. <eos> i sat down in a gazebo watching the lake and enjoying the tranquility.  <eos> there is a grand church near the lake. <eos> a dam is located not too far away from the lake and the church. <eos> the occupants of the castle-looking house are fortunate to live near the blue lake.
a lovely calm lake, great scenery and wonderful to relax by. <eos> a monument telling of the great thing that happened here. <eos> a lovely clock tower in the distance, i'm sure it holds great history. <eos> what a wonderful historic building behind the iron gate. <eos> close up of the clock tower,i bet it could tell some secrets.
a man walked around the edge of the lake one day. <eos> he arrived at the gazebo, and began setting up his instruments. <eos> there was a college nearby. <eos> he ran over quickly to check the time, unsure when to begin his show. <eos> checking the time, he headed back to the gazebo to begin his show.
he was a huge stevie ray vaughan fan.  <eos> even though he grew up taking piano, he had taught himself to play guitar.  <eos> he sounded like stevie ray.  <eos> he looked like stevie ray.  <eos> he was so good some people were convinced he was stevie ray vaughan's reincarnation. 
the crowd seemed nice, but i didn't know anyone there. <eos> our first show was a house party for a coworker's friend. <eos> i was nervous, and told them so. <eos> but when we started playing, all of the nerves faded away.  <eos> and i could tell the crowd was lost in the music too.
the friends met up for drinks. <eos> it was a fun night out for everyone. <eos> the next morning everyone played instruments. <eos> ron had played the guitar since he was a kid. <eos> that night everyone got ready to go out and do the same thing again.
i went to a party last night. <eos> all my friends were there. <eos> we played games. <eos> one friend brought his guitar and played. <eos> we had so much fun together and we laughed all night..
here i am taking a break before my next set. <eos> josie played the keyboard for awhile while i was gone. <eos> but then i came back and awed everyone with my melancholy tunes. <eos> not a dry eye was left in the house as i played. <eos> my wife sadie said it was like hearing inside of eternity.
we headed into the mountains to tour the beautiful landscape. <eos> it was absolutely amazing and breathtaking. <eos> there were rustic fences alongside the edge to act as guardrails. <eos> we pulled the car over at one scenic overlook. <eos> the waves crashing against the rocks were captivating.
i decided to explore the beautiful coastline in california by taking a drive.  <eos> after driving for 45 minutes i found a nice spot to pull over and enjoy the view.  <eos> i pulled over into the spot. i was the only one there! <eos> i looked out of the drivers side window and saw this beautiful view. <eos> i got out of the car and looked over the edge down over the rocky outcroppings and to the ocean below. 
you could see for miles around. <eos> dust kicked up on the road by the cliff side. <eos> lot's of dust blew up near the fence. <eos> the car sat parked by itself next to the road. <eos> the water crashed against the cliffs.
the scenery on the road is peaceful and quiet.  <eos> the vehicle is preparing to stop for a break.  <eos> the driver stopped to take a picture of the scenery.  <eos> this portion of the mountain is not as cloudy. <eos> the water is crashing against the rocks. 
we wanted to find the perfect stop for a picture of the ocean. <eos> we realized we needed to get closer to the coast. <eos> we found a great turn off that came close to the view we wanted. <eos> it had a great view of the landscape, but still did not include the ocean. <eos> at last we found the perfect place to stop and got the picture we wanted.
today we did a lot of different things. <eos> we went an ate some food. <eos> then we got out into the water. <eos> we decided to go ride bicycles. <eos> it was a very active day.
i took my cat down to my boat with me. <eos> i invited a few of my friends to go with me. <eos> the sea was a little choppy. <eos> the waves were foamy. <eos> it was a lot of fun.
the cat sat in the driveway looking sad. <eos> the boys were happy to eat lunch at the local restaurant.  <eos> the ocean made small waves.  <eos> the dirt bikes laid there in the dirt.  <eos> the boys took a photo after they ate lunch.
cat begging for food on the sidewalk.  <eos> taking a quick breakfast before going out.  <eos> going on a boat ride in the need by island.  <eos> going mountain bike riding with family and friends.  <eos> quick lunch after going bike riding. 
said goodbye to kitty today for a week. will miss him. <eos> getting a drink before we hit the beach. <eos> look at the wave. no swimming today. <eos> heading down the trails for a bike ride. going to be fun. <eos> back in town for some much needed food with great friends.
the side walk looked so plain. <eos> we decided to plant some trees. <eos> after digging all day, we were finally ready. <eos> check out our tree. <eos> a beautiful tree to represent our beautiful friendship.
today was the big tree planting party. here is a picture of before the event. <eos> the finished product, a hole. now where is that tree?? <eos> there is tree? how could i misplace it? silly me! <eos> getting ready to do some serious work here.  <eos> and the boots are put into action! as well as shovels, muscles, etc. 
today, we went to help spruce up the town by planting small trees along the road. <eos> we started digging holes on where we planned on planting the trees. <eos> after the holes were dug, everyone stood back to admire their work. <eos> the girls posed next to the new tree they helped plant. <eos> overall, the tree was firmly planted and ready to start growing tall.
sarah and i decided to join the neighborhood friends of trees club. <eos> on a rainy day, we went out with the club and dug holes for trees. <eos> it was a lot of work, as the holes had to be quite deep. <eos> planting our first tree was exciting! the club took our picture, as is their tradition. <eos> whenever we see the tree we planted, we feel pretty excited!
i went to my volunteer day at friends of trees <eos> here is the hole we dug to plant a tree. <eos> here's the tree we planted. <eos> i got kind of dirty but it was kind of cool. <eos> here is the team working on some more trees.
the park was a great place to skate. <eos> it was filled with many trees. <eos> skating amateurs performed stunts on steps. <eos> the activity lasted into the evening. <eos> when the sky darkened, they left.
hanging out with abraham, getting some skate time in. <eos> hit an olie of a two step, just warming up. <eos> abraham hit this sweet kickflip! it made for a great photo. <eos> manual up to a three step... <eos> into a frontside kickflip! my first time hitting this trick! i was super excited. 
i went to the skate park yesterday. <eos> i met a few other people while i was there and they challenged me to some tricks. <eos> they did their tricks first. <eos> they were very good. <eos> i was unable to do tricks as well as they were and i lost.
i was walking in the park and saw some boys riding their skateboards. <eos> they were practicing new tricks together. <eos> one rode his skateboard off the steps and flipped it midair!  <eos> they rode until the sun started going down. <eos> after they left, i quietly daydreamed of myself being able to ride a skateboard too!
my friend tony likes to do skateboard tricks. <eos> one day we went to the park to take pictures. <eos> griffin jumped off a set of stairs in a spectacular form. <eos> the sun shined down on the trees and made a nice scenery. <eos> we noticed there were palm trees everywhere as we left. 
i took a trip with my camper in tow. <eos> my kid had a great time. <eos> i took some pictures. <eos> and then i took even more pictures. <eos> then we drove off.
the family parked their airstream trailer. <eos> grandpa couldn't wait to start taking pictures. <eos> the little girl just wanted to run! <eos> she had a lot of energy! <eos> soon, her footprints could be seen everywhere.
dan wanted to take his daughter to the desert  <eos> she had such a fun time going down the hills <eos> dan took lots and lots pictures <eos> he was loving the scenery around <eos> and they headed back home 
i took the family in my trailer for a year of adventure. <eos> we plan on driving all over the country to see what we can see. <eos> i made sure to bring all of my camera equipment so that we can take plenty of pictures. <eos> it's going to be so much fun and i want to be sure to capture every moment. <eos> we are going to have a great time.
bring the trailer to the mountains <eos> getting ready to take a picture <eos> my daughter running down a snowpacked slope <eos> my daughter having fun on the slope <eos> the snow packed lanscape
this is the entrance to a wild life preserve in washington.  <eos> up on the bluffs you will find many animals and insects that are declining in numbers around the world.  <eos> this gathering of butterflies no longer takes place in a lot of locations like it use to.  <eos> this is a rare hawk that is going extinct very rapidly.  <eos> this breed of elk is starting to grow in numbers but not out of the woods quite yet. 
the wildlife is magnificent. <eos> this bird is displayed in beauty. <eos> there is so much diversity. <eos> everything is beaming with life. <eos> the colors are everywhere from the bird to the butterfly.
nature is fascinating it. <eos> even where things seem lifeless. <eos> there is an overabundance of creatures within. <eos> from birds of prey stalking the skys. <eos> to mammals grazing across the plains. 
we went for a walk in the woods. <eos> the country was rocky. <eos> we looked at the mushrooms grow on the trees. <eos> the wild life was unique. <eos> we saw what looked like a reindeer. 
we took a walk through a bird park this afternoon. <eos> there were woodpeckers. <eos> we even saw many bird's nest around. <eos> the mountains were lively with water falls. <eos> we saw many cool looking insects like this buttlerfly.
the park was filled with beauty. <eos> there was a stream beneath rocks. <eos> and wooden structures that supported plants. <eos> the two wondered how to spend the afternoon in such a serene place. <eos> they opted for a nap.
i went to the flower garden last week. <eos> they have a lot of beautiful plants there. <eos> i took some of them. <eos> nobody noticed they were missing. <eos> afterward i went back home.
josh and mike went to the botanical gardens. <eos> there were beautiful waterways and trees. <eos> the moss hanging down caught josh's attention. <eos> i think they have decided it is a good time to take a nap. <eos> and i think they've found the perfect spot.
rick loved going to the lake. he just loved the scenery. it was beautiful and romantic. <eos> he loved the beautiful trees, and the way the water in the lake flowed. <eos> he loved walking under the underpass and playing with the mistletoes that drooped from above over his head. <eos> he most of all loved going to the lake with his boyfriend jake. <eos> rick and jake would spend hours at a time there. after they'd look at all the beautiful sights to see, they'd lay down in the grass and talk about their life together.
the garden tour was cool. these flowers are so pretty. <eos> this tree has moss growing on it. looks creepy. <eos> dave is checking out the vine growing over the trellis. <eos> oh that's a good look for you, dave. you should keep that. <eos> the flowers are so pretty. need them in my yard.
our school went on a tour of a botanical garden. <eos> it had a few nice water features like this one. <eos> mostly though, it had lots of pretty flowers. <eos> i loved this colorful rose. <eos> my favorite thing was the koi pond. such beautiful fish!
whenever i can, i try to take a walk in the afternoon. <eos> today my first stop was the pond. <eos> where i had a light lunch. <eos> then found a sunny spot for a nap. <eos> once i woke up, i found a refreshment for the walk home.
us and our close friends at a botanical garden.  <eos> there was a beautiful waterfall that we could see up close.  <eos> next we saw the flowers, this pink one was an all around favorite.  <eos> this rose was also a close second favorite.  <eos> lastly we watched the fish in the koi pond. 
my class went on a trip to local park. <eos> there, they had some small waterfalls. <eos> the flower we saw were exquisite. <eos> there were so many different color buds. <eos> we ended the day by a pond filled with goldfish.
i love to go on nature walks. <eos> there are beautiful lily pads in the pond behind my house. <eos> there are also colorful coi fish. <eos> the warm sun shines down on a fallen tree. <eos> the little waterfall reminds me how breath taking nature is.
visiting a chinese temple with our pet doe. <eos> he's tired but we still have a lot of places we haven't explored. <eos> this is john doe. get it? <eos> beautiful temple. the red paint very vibrant. <eos> beautiful lake. there were also some swans but i didn't take a pic of them.
the first thing we did when we got off the train in nara, japan was to feed the deer in the park. <eos> they are used to humans so you can find plenty of them near the entrances to the temples as well. <eos> it is hard to really show the scope of how large this particular temple was, but this is the exterior.  <eos> i really loved seeing this giant buddha which had a very peaceful presence.  <eos> inside the temple you could attempt to put yourself through this support post are said to be blessed with enlightenment in the next life. 
we met this deer while we were touring. <eos> we followed him along for a while. <eos> he actually took us to some cool places. <eos> we went inside to look at things. <eos> the deer actually stayed there like he was waiting for us!
a deer follows a man on the sidewalk. <eos> the man pets the deers mother. <eos> the deer gets close to the camera and the man snaps a picture. <eos> the man then goes to an asian temple of some kind. <eos> he then relaxes on a mini island.
we visited china and got to see animals along the way. <eos> there was even a deer that looked comfortable with people. <eos> the architecture is very beautiful. <eos> the buddhist statue presents a holy aura. <eos> lastly, we had fun where it was needed.
we crossed the bridge in the park heading for the stream. <eos> as we got closer, we could hear the water getting louder. <eos> natural rock formation provided glimpses of the area around the stream. <eos> when we got to the source of the sound, we found a waterfall. <eos> the waterfall and pool created a sort of grotto in the back wall of the rock.
since the weather was so nice, we decided to go hiking on some local trails. <eos> the kids had a lot of fun playing in and around the natural rock formations. <eos> near a flowing stream, we saw a beautiful tree with white blossoms.  <eos> we came to a foot bridge that crossed over the stream, and lead to the trail up the mountain side.  <eos> the hike up the mountain was tough, but the views were well worth it. 
we started our hike at the beautiful old bridge. <eos> next we saw the lovely tiny creek. <eos> from there we saw many different things along the way including this hole in the tree. <eos> this was far and away our favorite part of the hike.  <eos> it's beauty was only surpassed by its wonder.
someone is in the bushes. <eos> he climbs up the bumpy hill. <eos> he looks down upon the stream. <eos> he comes across a beautiful waterfall. <eos> he then finds a secret passageway under the waterfall.
the rickety old bridge had been there for as long as anyone could remember.  <eos> along the trail, there were steep caverns  <eos> unusual rock formations were abundant.  <eos> you could see a waterfall in the distance.  <eos> the river seemed to disappear in the mountain. 
he had never been to such a majestic place before. <eos> the locals told him all about the beauty of the land. <eos> information was written in stone to tell him about it. <eos> the mountains were beautiful. <eos> he stood atop them and looked at the vast canyon.
we went to the park and a deer followed us. <eos> we pet it and took pictures with it. <eos> then we traveled to the marvelous hotel. <eos> the grounds were so immaculate. <eos> we also got great pictures of the outside decor.
i went to a restaurant with a friend of mine yesterday. <eos> we hadn't seen each other in a long time. <eos> afterward we decided to go on a hike through the wilderness. <eos> there was nobody else out there. <eos> we had a great view at the end of the hike.
the mountains loomed in the distance as i started my hike through the sparsely vegetated desert. <eos> the only paths were dirt roads marked by the rangers who travelled them regularly through the wilderness. <eos> as i climbed higher and higher there was more greenery and the view was spectacular. <eos> i even tried my hand at rock climbing the towering stacks of boulders that were deposited everywhere. <eos> once i climbed to the top the view took my breath away; i could see everywhere i had just hiked in one glance.
it was a perfect day to spend outdoors.  <eos> a hike seemed like a good idea.  <eos> spring was the best time to hike in the mountains.  <eos> rock climbing was also good that day.  <eos> the views were magnificent. 
the god of fog and mist was angry. <eos> he stood ever vigilant over his lands. <eos> however the rivers and lakes were polluted. <eos> man had caused this, and man would be punished in never-ending fog. <eos> the mists and fogs rolled in, the god knew this would be mankind's final days.
going on a hiking trip in this area will be a blast <eos> what is all that smoke from? <eos> the water is so hot it is boiling the mud <eos> we found this old bridge to cross the treacherous  <eos> and at the other side of the bridge we see these great statues!
the jungle was misty and spooky the day we visited the national park. <eos> you could see the remains of trees that had burned in a fire that swept over the land a few years ago. <eos> the tar pits were constantly bubbling, emitting gas and steam. <eos> the bridge crossing the pits was covered with a fine ash from the residue. <eos> there were giant tiki statues everywhere paying homage to the native populations that settled the land.
today i experienced the art of another culture. <eos> giant statues were created almost a century ago in indonesia. <eos> there were hidden lakes that made for good vacation spots. <eos> an eerie bridge scared me because of the fog. <eos> i ended up walking down the bridge and going home. 
"walking through the hazy jungle. <eos> ""what is that?"" <eos> sploosh! ""be careful numnuts!"" ""aieeee pull me out dave!"" <eos> ""where is this place?"" <eos> """"sorry al turns out the native new zealanders figured out the true gods. hell is thataway"". "
i rode on the bus to get to work yesterday. <eos> it was a long ride. <eos> i fell asleep during it. <eos> when we finally got close i woke up. <eos> i had five more minutes until we would arrive.
was it foggy outside or was it smoke from the inside?  <eos> being an old hippie sometimes had its disadvantages.  <eos> seeing the world through a haze and fringe wasn't everything she had thought it might be. <eos> they lived on the road.  <eos> her home was the highway and she longed for stability. 
a photo of the bus i was on when i took a trip.  <eos> the bus is still on the freeway, after driving a few hours.  <eos> the weather is a little sunnier, but we are still on the road.  <eos> i decided to stop for the night at this hotel.  <eos> the next day i was back on the road. 
lucy was driving up north to visit her parents. though it wasn't the drive she loved. <eos> she would take i-80 and eventually merge on to i-95 north. <eos> lucy looked up at the sky. it looked like rain was coming. she hated driving in the rain. <eos> lucy saw many big trucks going the opposite way. it must be a big day for deliveries she thought, as she continued her journey. <eos> lucy thought to herself, thank you lord, the skies have cleared up. it didn't look like rain anymore, but she still had four more hours of driving before she'd reach her parents house in michigan. 
we took a drive across the country last summer. <eos> it was a great feeling being on the open road. <eos> nothing compares to having a whole road to yourself! <eos> well, most of the time anyways! <eos> it was a great trip and we got to see many places.
when i went on vacation last year i saw some interesting things. <eos> there were a lot of unique trees there. <eos> they were all very old. <eos> they were very unique. <eos> i took some samples of them.
about to start our journey into the jungle. <eos> these trees are so old, moss are other plant life start to grow all around. <eos> looking up towards the canopy, monkeys can be seen playing. <eos> this tree curved at an upward angle.  <eos> the view from the top was breathtaking. 
while on vacation, we went to the jungle. <eos> in the woods there were some many sights to see. <eos> we even saw a monkey there. <eos> my friends climbed all over the trees. <eos> looking out across the expanse was beautiful.
we took a trip to the forest today. <eos> there were so many huge trees. <eos> the trees had been there for a very long time. <eos> it was so majestic looking up at the trees. <eos> it was a great day and we have so much fun exploring the forest.
we're exploring the forest today <eos> there are a lot of interesting trees and growth. <eos> there are even wild monkeys. <eos> there are some wild monkeys among our group too <eos> exploring god's creation is marvelous.
flowers bloom. <eos> squirrels gather nuts for winter. <eos> flowers don't care what squirrels do. <eos> squirrels don't care what flowers do. <eos> flowers bloom some more.
testing my new amazing camera. <eos> the close up shot of this cactus is amazing. the quality. <eos> i try to get an even closer view of the cactus. the quality is still there. <eos> this squirrel is actually 30 feet away from me. i kept zooming in and got this amazing photo. <eos> the details of this shot is amazing. you can see all the pores on the tips.
the flowers had come into bloom. <eos> the squirrel was hungry, what would he eat? <eos> he saw the purple plant. <eos> he decided to go with the yellow flower. <eos> oh no, he didn't notice his favorite plant, the red one.
i went for a walk through the woods yesterday. <eos> there were a lot of squirrels watching me. <eos> i found some interesting plants while i was out there. <eos> the squirrels watched me for hours. <eos> the flowers are very beautiful this time of the year.
a girl looks at a dying sunflower. <eos> she then sees a fat squirrel eating. <eos> she looks at purple flowers. <eos> but then she goes back to the fat squirrel. <eos> she then comes across a flower she didn't see before.
i finally got to the house just beyond the marsh. <eos> i had to cross the creepy lake. <eos> after having made it across the wobbly bridge. <eos> even before that i walked through the suffocating swamp. <eos> the swamp had started as an upsetting stream of dead fishes, flies, and frogs.
heavy flood in our town. testing the new camera that i got. <eos> the flood is starting to subside but you can see there are still quite a lot of water. <eos> frogs are being washed up. <eos> 24x zoom on the nikon camera. <eos> 64x zoom. the quality is amazing.
the city had old charm architecture.  <eos> the water flowed slowly between the trees.  <eos> the old walkway was loosely planted on the ground.  <eos> the plants stuck out from the water.  <eos> the water became swampy. 
we left the house and headed into the swamp. <eos> we went a ways before finding a trail. <eos> we went over a small man made bridge at one point. <eos> thenit was back into the swamp. <eos> we passed by a large tree before heading back out.
we walked through the village and saw a hawk flying in the air. <eos> the village was covered in mud from all the rain. <eos> then we found a frog hiding in the grass. <eos> after that came to a sheep with her babies. <eos> we watched them as they ate.
the gardening course was filled with fun. <eos> edible offshoots were grown. <eos> flowers were popular among some growers. <eos> different species were examined on the table. <eos> some contained only a few blooms.
i am artistic. <eos> i take artistic photos. <eos> today it's of plants. <eos> like this one. <eos> it has lots of leaves.
this brown seed pod was the first plant clipping i collected last weekend. <eos> i found this branch that looked like it was growing berries. <eos> these flowers were just about in bloom, so i grabbed them to put in water later. <eos> the long, beautiful leaves on this plant made a nice addition to my collection. <eos> the last clipping i took was this hearty looking leaf, which had a smooth waxy coating.
the shells were opened, <eos> and the insides came out. <eos> the botanists were enraptured with the process, <eos> so they grew more plants <eos> and started the life cycle all over again. 
the banana was putrid, rotted compelty.  <eos> a few of the berries still seemed viable.  <eos> a flower had managed to blossom.  <eos> the eucalyptus was still fragrant.  <eos> no one believed this sick little plant would survive. 
a lady went to visit this seaside town. <eos> it was a very pretty and spacious town. <eos> the architecture was also very cool and unique. <eos> her favorite meal from this plate was this dessert. <eos> she clearly loves it!
she had wanted to visit the area for a long time. <eos> she had finally made it. <eos> the day started with a quick drink. <eos> then it was off to see the sights. <eos> she even came across a vintage car.
reina was excited to finally make the trip to san jose.  <eos> she had heard for years that the town was filled with gorgeous nature <eos> and beautiful architecture.  <eos> little did she know, though that it was also famous for its drinks, <eos> but she soon learned as she quickly downed her delicious drink. it was a great trip. 
liz was so happy to be on vacation.  <eos> she had a great view of the mountains from her hotel.  <eos> she went to the local restaurant nearby.  <eos> she had herself a tasty corn dish.  <eos> she loved the sweet taste and texture of her food as she posed for a picture. 
the water glistened with the suns first rays.  <eos> she dressed warmly that day.  <eos> she tried an exotic drink in the local bar.  <eos> she posed at the original well site.  <eos> the most amazing thing she saw was an old rolls royce being used as a planter. 
a girl went to visit this building. <eos> it was a really nice architecturally styled building. <eos> she particularly found the pillars very interesting. <eos> it even had a nice garden. <eos> there was even a garden for her to try some of the herbs.
we go to a park. it is so nice.  <eos> this lady admires the view. it is so green. <eos> she thinks twice about stepping on the plant. she wants to be careful. <eos> there is another tree growing near the scene. it is very beautiful. <eos> this lady wants to remember this moment forever. she takes a photo next to the tree.
marlene was excited for the picnic today, <eos> but nobody showed up! <eos> she walked around the premises, <eos> but still she saw nobody. <eos> she was livid, but there was nothing she could do, so she picnicked alone. 
she volunteered to work in the campus garden.  <eos> it was starting to look better with each passing day.  <eos> she hoped to get large potted plants to put in each arch.  <eos> the flowers she had planted were doing exceptionally well.  <eos> for her, it was a labor of love. 
lola leaned against a column and surveyed the yard of her new house. <eos> the grounds were immaculately kept. <eos> the breezeway provided a much needed respite from the sun. <eos> lola planted beautiful herbs and was able to have them anytime she wanted. <eos> she could not have been prouder of her new home.
the field was so filled with beautiful flowers and animals. <eos> the flwere were such a perfect mix of colors.  <eos> the little bridge gave it such a nice touch. <eos> the water was so clear you could see all the fish swimming. <eos> the goose had a little baby it was watching after.
i love nature. <eos> the beautiful dragonflies. <eos> the pretty flowers. <eos> the grand views. <eos> and the baby geese.
we hiked out to the nearby lake last week and it was a beautiful day. <eos> we saw so many pretty flowers, including these delicate white and yellow ones. <eos> we crossed a small wooden bridge that was really quaint. <eos> light green moss blanketed the ground like a living carpet. <eos> we passed by this cute little family of ducks as we made our way back home.
large mushrooms cascaded down the old tree stump.  <eos> a dragon fly rested on a leaf over the water.  <eos> the waterlilies were beginning to bloom.  <eos> the road had lush greenery on both side.  <eos> a family of ducks ate their morning meal. 
it was a lovely day outside. <eos> this little bug landed on a leave plant. <eos> then he made up his mind to move to another flower. <eos> the fields were very beautiful. <eos> he seen some of his duck buddies and decided to say hello.
i went to a village. <eos> many trees grew there. <eos> they were taking over. <eos> the village was in ruins. <eos> but it was still epic.
it was the entrance to the ancient city. we were all excited. <eos> these buildings were absolute wonders. <eos> this tree majestically soured into the sky. <eos> this tree actually became part of the city. <eos> before we left we snapped one more shot of this amazing temple. 
the tourists excitedly walked through the safari park.  <eos> they were excited to see the animals <eos> and the oddly shaped trees. <eos> they trekked through the park <eos> in search of the hiding animals. 
the ancient structure was taken over by the plants.  <eos> a tree had taken root and grown very tall on top the building.  <eos> another tree had knees with roots that covered the stone fence.  <eos> moss was beginning to grow on the ancient wall.  <eos> from the doorway you could see the plants on the other side. 
the tour took place in the ruins of a thai village. <eos> they showed us the old buddisht temple remains. <eos> the old trees around the property were thousands of years old. <eos> they grew deep and wide into the ground. <eos> the old decaying structure was a great and scary.
i climbed the stairs. <eos> the lead to this place. <eos> it was a beautiful stream. <eos> it was in the jungle. <eos> and there was a waterfall.
the teen outreach group went on a hike. <eos> the kids were all very excited to get to explore nature.  <eos> they got up close and personal with the wild. <eos> and stopped for a break and a picnic lunch. <eos> they were all very impressed by the majesty of the outdoors.
there was no one on the stairs <eos> there was no one in the water. <eos> the park was completely abandoned. <eos> but maybe it was all for the best, the plants thought, because now no one will step on us <eos> and the animals will be free to roam around as they please. 
the stairs meandered down the hillside among the lush, tropical vegetation.  <eos> the sounds of the small brook were peaceful.  <eos> a small waterfall intensified the sounds of the water.  <eos> the underbrush was thick.  <eos> a larger waterfall was ahead beyond the path. 
a group of friends got together for a hike. <eos> they made their way up the mountain. <eos> being careful not to slip and fall. <eos> after reaching the top they sit down for a short rest. <eos> they really take in the beauty of the mountain top by taking a picture of this waterfall.
the leaf was perfectly shaped.  <eos> the pink was so bright on these flowers.  <eos> the white flowers had a hint of pink to them. <eos> these flowers were shaped strangely, but pretty.  <eos> i never saw a flower like this. 
i love nature. <eos> look at all the colors. <eos> the flowers were pretty. <eos> the lily was huge. <eos> and the leaves were abundant.
nature is so beautiful at this time of year, all the leaves turn green.  <eos> there are bright pink flowers that adorn the trees.  <eos> the water flowers appear from the pond.  <eos> this particular pond has huge water lillies that float on the water.  <eos> there are many different types of vegetation growing in the water. 
with all the plants coming back to life it was the perfect time to visit the botanical garden.  <eos> the smallest pedals produced vivid colors.  <eos> the white blossoms were so fragrant.  <eos> in the water pond three new platforms had been added.  <eos> the small waterlilies were doing quite well already. 
i have been outside doing micro photography for a class project.  <eos> love how it is possible to get a good blur in pictures like this.  <eos> these flowers were so beautiful. one of my class subjects is nature.  <eos> nothing beats getting out and taking pictures of sites like this. most people never experience this.  <eos> last but not least a single red flower. this day of shooting turned out very good. 
we wanted to get closer to nature so we took a grass pathway. <eos> we got to the shaded area under some trees. <eos> a few miles away was a lake that we really enjoyed watching. <eos> my friend found this patch of grass. <eos> i was really amazed at the complexity of the trees.
this is one of my pet chuchi. we love to walked every morning. <eos> along the way we found a butterfly that injured on the left wing.  <eos> as we walked we see this beautiful nature that full of greens. <eos> on the other side we have this view in which no leaves on the tree. <eos> after 2 weeks this is what happen to the tree. so sad to look at.
the farm stretched for acres and miles, more than i could count.  <eos> all of the trees provided ample shade.  <eos> the lake has a beautiful blue color.  <eos> minimal plants grew on the dirt filled hills.  <eos> a woodpecker made a hole in the tree. 
there were lots of neat things to take pictures of on our trip to the country. this guy was checking us out. <eos> i've never seen a butterfly like this. isn't it pretty? <eos> the grass was so green from all the rain. <eos> there were some trees that hadn't gotten their leaves back yet. <eos> i thought this deadwood was really beautiful, too, like tall sentinels. 
pepper found her way home. <eos> she went chasing after a butterfly. <eos> she chased to the woods. <eos> we found her by the water. <eos> she has gotten frightened.
today was our botany hike, we planned to take pictures of all sorts of stuff. <eos> we found a cool berry, not sure what it is, bu it looked pretty. <eos> mandatory banana slug picture, you'll see one on every hike. <eos> we found a cool little succulent plant growing on a rocky area. <eos> although we didn't see many flowering plants, we found these two species all over the forest floor.
though sometimes it may be hard to see. <eos> i know i live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. <eos> i may not be as beautiful it's true.  <eos> but everyday i do my job eating all of the decaying forest vegetation.  <eos> so that new things can grow around me.
i went out for a hike out in the hills this morning while it was foggy. i thought the light would be great for some photography. <eos> the fog got thicker as i hiked up into the trees. <eos> i found a neat-looking banana slug making its way along some rocks, and snapped a photo <eos> later, i found another banana slug, and got an even better close-up shot. <eos> finally, i came across this neat, brightly-colored succulent. it made for another great photo!
this was the most organic hiking trip i've been on.  <eos> the berries looked like something straight out of willy wonka's factory.  <eos> the animals had a very jurassic park feel to them.  <eos> i felt like everything looked colorful and thus probably poisonous.  <eos> the only sane looking thing was the flowers, at least they looked normal. 
we went on a nature hike today. <eos> there were many beautiful things around the forest. <eos> we even got to see some wildlife. <eos> we took many pictures of all the plants. <eos> we had a great time and got so many great pictures.
the windows on this restaurant have this cool embellishment. <eos> the back has a cool retro feel to it. <eos> they light up the trees all around the building. <eos> the white dog was just hanging around and enjoying the day <eos> you could see a house through the brush.
this is my house. <eos> it's not very good. <eos> neither is this picture. <eos> but there's my dog. <eos> he runs through this yard.
everything was looking nice. <eos> the weather was getting cold. <eos> the trees were lit up for all to see. <eos> people walked on the city streets. <eos> they didn't know when the weather would turn.
i left the house i just got to go see the community. <eos> stopped by the neighbors but no one was home. <eos> they had lights set for christmas in their trees <eos> the street itself was simple and relaxing. <eos> we walked back home through the trail and called it a day.
todd wanted to fix up his old house.  <eos> he wanted to redo the bricks on the outside.  <eos> he got inspiration to also add lights from his neighbor.  <eos> he walked down to the local hardware store to buy his supplies.  <eos> he also remembered he needed to mow his front lawn. 
there were lots of cars. <eos> they were blurry. <eos> there was a lake. <eos> the tree fell in the lake. <eos> i saw a spider too.
timmy and i went on a nature walk. i made sure his jacket was on since it is a little bit cold. he said he wanted to bring his frisbee that daddy had bought him. <eos> look at the size of this leaf! it is huge. we saw several this size. we also saw mushrooms. <eos> timmy said he was hot, so i took off his jacket. he is such a cutie! <eos> timmy was really interested in the spider and web. i thought the web had a cool design.  <eos> but, i backed up when i saw the size of this spider. it was so big!
our son showing of his new toy.  <eos> a wild mushroom patch that we ran across while at the park.  <eos> a photo of our son while at the park with the sun setting. <eos> a picture of mother nature making some fine art.  <eos> interesting spider making his home. a true art piece. 
i finally tried some time lapse photography. <eos> it was a little too foggy. <eos> i changed to taking art type pictures. <eos> this was a pretty scene. <eos> finally i tried a macro shot.
this child was so happy to play outside.  <eos> he found some mushrooms in the field.  <eos> all of a sudden he got really scared.  <eos> he felt something sticky against his hands.  <eos> it turned out he touched the spiderweb of a hungry spider. 
this is a prime example of how hard working ants really are. <eos> this monarch is pure beauty. <eos> the flowers were in full bloom and beautiful <eos> this was a very cool looking flower <eos> the swallow was sitting on a branch.
i like bugs. <eos> butterflies to be precise. <eos> like this black one. <eos> or this guy. <eos> or this gal.
nature can be so beautiful at times. <eos> sometimes it doesn't even look real. <eos> this could be on a postcard. <eos> they are so peaceful to look at. <eos> yet have so much beauty at the same time.
this tropical climate was perfect for plants growing everywhere.  <eos> this butterfly was about to have an interesting day.  <eos> it had eaten the nectar from this flower first.  <eos> then it started feeding on this flower.  <eos> all of a sudden a bird flew down from the sky and ate the butterfly. 
this rope had ants all over it at the botanical garden. <eos> a really cool butterfly getting something to eat. <eos> some amazing flowers at the botanical garden. <eos> this flower had a really cool center. <eos> they even had birds at the botanical gardens.
the water ran over the funny shaped rocks. <eos> the weather must have shaped a lot of the rocks there. <eos> the water trickled over some of the rocks. <eos> thee was an old little house in the middle of the area. <eos> the water had overflowed here and was finally drying up.
we decided to go for a nature walk and found this babbling brook. <eos> this old bridge was incredibly beautiful. <eos> the old gear mechanisms really put you back in time. <eos> this old shack and mill was the highlight of our day. <eos> we went back home from our favorite trail. 
it was a great day to take a hike. <eos> they never knew where they were going next. <eos> old machinery was still in its place. <eos> what a simpler time they lived in. <eos> there was so much to see all around.
we passed a small waterfall <eos> small and natural structures were around the lake. <eos> every little ways we would come up to another waterfall. <eos> then, hidden away was a tiny mill. <eos> we followed the dried up stream that used to feed it.
made a trip to the smoky mountains and stopped to take a picture of the river with the mini waterfalls.  <eos>  some of the rocks here look like nature carved out a seat for me.  <eos> the water coming down like this is always so pretty.  <eos> what a stunning old water mill it does not work any longer but it is still so beautiful in itself.  <eos> the water in the spring is so dry. i bet during the early spring this has tons of water flowing through it. 
the morning brought fresh air and the trees were lively. <eos> i found a leaf on the ground. <eos> we took the trail to find the nearest bridge. <eos> when we arrived at the bridge, we realized we were five minutes away from home. <eos> when we got home, we took a picture from inside.
it is officially the fall season because i can see that some trees have already turned their leaves to that beautiful color while others will soon follow. <eos> i am inside and look out at all the beauty of the fall and i wish it could be like this year round. <eos> long walks in the cool autumn air down country roads makes me go back in time to when i used to hunt and fish. <eos> i always loved going out in the country in the fall and to me it was the perfect time for everything including football. <eos> this pictures sums it all up for me when i say that fall is the most beautiful season and the one that i can't wait for every year.
we took a stroll to see the fall tree colors. <eos> here's a fallen leaf. <eos> the trail was really quite beautiful. <eos> here we are farther up along it towards the old cabin in the woods. <eos> we made it to the dark cabin and stayed inside for the night.
fall is my favorite season. <eos> i love how pretty the leaves are. <eos> it is a great time to walk through the forest. <eos> so many leaves have already fallen. <eos> i love seeing the trees from my house. i love this season!
it was a beautiful fall day. <eos> i decided to go for a walk to enjoy the fallen leaves. <eos> walking in the forest, the weather was beautiful. <eos> i knew once i reached the bridge over the creek it was time to turn back to go home. <eos> i enjoyed the rest of the beautiful fall day from my window.
the leaves on the trees were starting to change colors. <eos> there were still a few bright colors to be seen. <eos> the boy drove his bike to the store. <eos> there was a small power station on the side of the building. <eos> the building was closed, but had just put up new signs.
after finishing up his laundry he had other chores. <eos> he finished his household work and took a walk down the street. <eos> he crossed the intersection. <eos> he was craving a cigarette but the smoke shop was closed. <eos> at last he made it to the convenience store to by a cold drink and a pack of cigarettes.
the city streets had trees in autumn foliage. <eos> there were beautiful flowers everywhere. <eos> the city was very bike friendly. <eos> there were all kinds of interesting vending machines that we weren't use to seeing. <eos> the quaint buildings had colorful signs around them.
we passed through the back yard on the way out <eos> the flowers outside always make the walk better. <eos> passed on to a street to stop by the gas station. <eos> passing the pumps on the way out. i decided to take the road back. <eos> i arrived back at the front of the house without issue.
it is early morning here and the flowers are open now. <eos> always love how the colors of red are used in china town.  <eos> this is one of the few places open at this hour of the day.  <eos> you can find many old machines like this sitting outside the stores here.  <eos> even in the subdivisions near by you see the chinese decorations displayed. 
my family and i went to an indoor arboretum. <eos> they had a fountain inside. <eos> the indoor pond had lily-pads. <eos> some of the fruit trees actually had fruit on them. <eos> they even had a chocolate tree.
we went to saw many exotic flowers and gardens today. this flower looks like it has fingers! <eos> this yellow flowers are petite and cute. the yellow is very mellow. <eos> the lily pads just floated in the water. it is cool how they stay at the top of the water. <eos> believe in or not this is a chocolate tree. unfortunately, it is not edible! <eos> this was my favorite one. the grass grew in the middle of the flower. how cool is that?
the gardens had all types of plants, both indoors and outdoors. <eos> there were beautiful fountains along the walkway. <eos> my favorite were the blossoming water lillies. <eos> some plants had exotic fruits growing. <eos> each plant had a sign with a short description about it.
timothy was a huge fan of the local nature preserve. he took pictures of almost every plant he saw. <eos> he was able to capture some beautiful details, like this buttery yellow flowers. <eos> his pictures of the floating lilies were exquisite.  <eos> i loved his weird pictures too, like this strange plant with a big hanging pod. <eos> he made me realize every flower has a huge amount of beauty close up.
this was the first thing we saw as we entered the botanical gardens. <eos> a small pool that was on display at the botanical gardens. <eos> some lily pads floating in another pool at the gardens. <eos> an apple that was able to grow inside at the gardens. <eos> this trees had some kind of melon growing on it.
the pink flowers really stood out that day. <eos> i took the longest trail to the garden. <eos> the garden led me to a clearing in the forest. <eos> many people were already at the spot. <eos> i noticed the harvesting lines when i walked around.
today we went cor lunch at a new garden  <eos> after lunch we walked through the many fields of flowers <eos> the beautiful pink ones reminded me of hawaii  <eos> there were purple lilies with polka dots too <eos> then we walked down the entrance path home
we eat a hearty breakfast before setting out on our nature walk. <eos> the meadow is full of flora and fauna. <eos> these fuchsia flowers really stand out against the green fields. <eos> the orchids are the most beautiful flowers i have seen. <eos> but my favorite thing is the leaning trees. i wonder about how they grow like that. mother nature is awesome.
i've always had a fondness for two things: food and flowers.  <eos> flowers are diverse and beautiful in each of their own ways, like people.  <eos> i know more people named after this flower than i do named roger, grace or deaken.  <eos> some flowers define a person's attire. whoever likes this flower must be a fan of plaid.  <eos> some represent size, i wish i was as tall as a tree. 
i was so excited to go the botanic garden today. <eos> the walkways through the garden were paved, making it easy to walk through it. <eos> i finally reached an open field where i could stop and rest. <eos> it was the perfect place to have a little picnic lunch. <eos> after lunch, i continued to walk through the garden, enjoying it even though some flowers had not yet bloomed.
today we are going on a little hike. <eos> he already seemed lost. <eos> she is exhausted after looking at how far there is to go. <eos> we ran in to a pile of rocks. <eos> we finally made it to the top. it was well worth it and an accomplish mission.
lola and friends went hiking to find  <eos> a spring. <eos> they walked many miles and saw a lot of green leaves. <eos> but finally she found the spring and spread her arms open in triumph. <eos> the spring was beautiful and well worth the hike.
today, i went on a hike in the woods with some friends. <eos> we traveled through some freshly fallen leaves. <eos> we also went through a very rocky path. <eos> during one of our breaks, we decided to build fun rock sculptures. <eos> once we got to the end of the trail, we took some pictures of the view, it was gorgeous.
me and a friend decided to go on a hike. <eos> it was a cold afternoon. <eos> the mountain was high and there were many rocks. <eos> we saw so many rocks we decided to build a tower with them. <eos> we ended up getting all the way to the top.
there was a big sign <eos> that the guy passed. <eos> the girl also saw it <eos> near the big rocks <eos> before they took a photo.
it was a bright sunny day in the city <eos> the city had a beautiful landscape with many statues <eos> and beautiful buildings <eos> the beach was stunning <eos> overall this place was very interesting to visit 
a founding father statue stands in front of the mountain range. <eos> a building looks out of place against the mountainside. <eos> the range is continual with rocky tops. <eos> at the bottom of the range is a sandy beach for fun seeking. <eos> hotels line the north side of the beach to lure in the tourists.
took a stroll through the city we are staying on vacation today. <eos> i decided i would ride one of these carts for the first time. <eos> the view i got from up so high was great. <eos> afterward headed down to the beach for a dip. <eos> really loved the water and how scenic walking back to the car was.
we met up at the statue of general tomasco. <eos> there was a ram there that would take us down to the beach. <eos> the view was very beautiful as we were riding it, showing us green shrubs with craggy mountains in the background. <eos> our first view of the beach was pretty amazing. all the people were so small. <eos> as we got closer to the shoreline, we got a great view of the buildings on the coastline.
it was a sunny day downtown near the clock tower. <eos> there was no one in sight, unless you count the statues. <eos> for some reason it was a quiet day around town. <eos> oh wait, that's because it was so nice that everyone decided to go to the beach. <eos> they had a great afternoon walking up those stairs that led to the pier and then out onto the sand or into the water. 
it was that time of year for a party. <eos> we wanted to make the outdoors look nice too. <eos> the whole town was ready. <eos> everyone started to come over. <eos> all in all it was a fun time and great weather.
going over to see my grandma for christmas this year. <eos> she lives in a very beautiful house outside of the city. <eos> it is always so beautiful out there this time of year. <eos> i was so happy to see my grandma and her great aunt. <eos> of course her dog is also part of the family! we had a great time.
the christmas decorations came out, <eos> even though it didn't look like winter outside. <eos> where the family lived didn't get much snow, <eos> but that didn't stop it from being cold. tommy still needed to wear pants and long sleeves to stay warm when he parked the car! <eos> christmas still came to that little house on the hill, even though it wasn't a white one. 
we started the holidays by settig up a tiny christmas tree. <eos> the streets where calm outside. everyone was celebrating the holidays. <eos> i went for an afternoon walk to my favorite spot before heading home. <eos> the family sat together and celebrated christmas. <eos> the night came to an end and everyone slowly went home.
we visited family for christmas. <eos> they live out in the country far from the city. <eos> the trees lost their leaves because it is so cold outside. <eos> they were so happy that we had arrived. <eos> even the dog had a marry christmas.
the sun rose quietly over the mountain, signalling the start of the new day. <eos> a solitary bird looked out over the campground. <eos> the young woman looked over the cheese selections and tried to decide which ones she wanted to take back to the campground. <eos> the young man smiled confidently for the camera, showing how much he enjoys his vacation. <eos> meanwhile, the large spider marched confidently down the hill, preparing to cause havoc at the camground.
we had an amazing time on our trip. we visited the chocolate factory and took home a few treats. <eos> we relaxed on the beach at sunset.  <eos> we explored a rainforest exhibit that had some terrifying spiders and beautiful trees.  <eos> in the afternoons, we relaxed in the yard.  <eos> the view from the house was breathtaking. it was hard to leave behind. 
our summer vacation this year was camping in the great outdoors. we were in for an adventure! <eos> we saw this eagle nesting in the tree near our campsite. such a beautiful bird! <eos> i went to the store to stock up on food for the weekend, while my husband set up the tent on our site. <eos> when i got back to the site, my husband had everything set up and was lounging in his chair. this was a great night. <eos> then, right before we went to bed..we saw this spider! it was gigantic! i insisted we head to a hotel instead.
we set out from camp early on. <eos> we got to see some birds along the trail from there. <eos> we looked at some of the local shops from there. <eos> afterwards, we chilled out by the campsite. <eos> then, a large spider walked up and made the night that much more interesting.
the first night of our vacation we saw a beautiful sunset. <eos> a beautiful black and white bird perched in the leafless tree. <eos> sandy chose from a variety of cheeses to find her favorite. <eos> ben relaxed in a comfortable chair beside the fire. <eos> the black hair spider looked real from a distance but was soon identified as fake.
the moon rose to a magnificent height that morning. <eos> the plains had a morning dew on them. <eos> i realized the plants near the tree were lovely. <eos> i also realized the simplicity of the brick wall. <eos> near the end of the day, i went to relax by the water.
there was a full moon that night.  <eos> the forest was perfectly spooky looking.  <eos> they found an old path.  <eos> if they saw sticks tied together like the blair witch movie, she intended to run.  <eos> she was relieved when they got to the castle safe and sound. 
this is the moon as we went on our annual camping trip! what a beautiful full moon! <eos> when we got up the next morning, we hiked over to the next village. this is the view overlooking the village.  <eos> we continued our hike and found many different colored leaves since it was fall.  <eos> as we continued to hike, we came to a brick wall that came between us and the village.  <eos> this is the wall that ended our hike. it was a great hike!
a full moon brings a melancholy mood the forest below. <eos> no sun the next morn to cheer the gray and dreary forest. <eos> one full of forgotten and hidden paths. <eos> the ground littered with dead wood and rotting leaves. <eos> a most formidable defense before the castle at its heart.
one night, a full moon out hung in the sky glowing with a red sheen. i couldn't sleep, and headed outside for some fresh air. <eos> wind whistled through the leafless trees, making an eerie sound. a shiver ran down my spine. <eos> i heard someone coming down the path, making heavy footfalls. it sounded someone was heading straight for me, and fast. <eos> panicking, i ducked behind a hill and threw some leaves over myself. i tried to stay perfectly still and quiet until the person passed by. <eos> when i was sure all was safe, i made my way carefully back to the castle. i had to get inside and tell someone what had just happened.
the family got together for a day out. <eos> they went to a fun museum. <eos> there were lots of interesting exhibits that everyone enjoyed. <eos> they had a good time spending the day together. <eos> everyone was worn out by the end of the day!
sara was happy to arrive at orientation.  <eos> she and her friend even slide down the stairs they were so energized. <eos> but when they got there this nerdy guy was talking about his invention.  <eos> and in the other room some kind of depressing support group was going on.  <eos> so sara and her friend left the building to find something more fun to do. 
our family all gathered together before we left for the museum to enjoy on summer break. <eos> first stop was to get all the information we needed. the desk kind of reminded me of a joker's hat for some reason. joy looked so pretty there. <eos> then off to the imaginary subway train to get into the actual museum, we felt silly. <eos> but, not as silly as these two who decided to slide down the stair railings. i thought for sure that the security guards were going to ask us to leave! <eos> at the end we took a group picture. we were all so tired and hungry. but over all, we had a delightful day.
the church tour was a complete success. <eos> the ladies posed in a funny way. <eos> chad likes to touch things with his hands. <eos> we went into a room and saw a group mourning someone's death. <eos> the outside of the building looked nice when i left.
our church is throwing a festival. <eos> the info station i helped setup! <eos> kids area, looks like so much fun! <eos> posing like weridos on he staircase! <eos> prayer circle in the worship center.
today i got to take a trip to my husbands work. this is the trolley.  <eos> here's me and my husband at his job. <eos> wow, a rocket, i think it will go to mars someday. <eos> what, a new car for the future, shhh, it flies but it's hush hush. <eos> here is another car, this one drives itself. shh, don't tell anyone.
here is the happy couple on vacation. <eos> i'm in the rocket taking it for a test drive. <eos> my wife is trying out her own rocket to see what she thinks. <eos> checking out the control panels to make sure i can operate them. <eos> before i get in i need to make sure i can drive it.
we arrived on a tram that went so quickly.  <eos> we were very excited to have finally arrived. <eos> all of the space materials were interesting to look at. <eos> there was even a ride that we were allowed to use. <eos> i myself took a test run in it. it was so much fun.
today, they decided to visit the aerospace center.  <eos> they were given rides in simulators.  <eos> she screamed during the entire ride.  <eos> she was particular interested in the control center.  <eos> he was more fascinated with the rides. 
my husband and i were finally going on a trip to the houston space center!  <eos> we got on the tram that leads you from the parking lot to the actual museum. <eos> when we got inside, they had an actual shuttle on display that was open so we could see the inside. <eos> they had lots of experimental vehicles on display and this really captivated my husband. <eos> he even got to test one of them out in a simulator. it was a great day and something we would definitely do again.
as night fell, the crowd gathered for the race. <eos> everyone game out with their fun costumes. <eos> the cold couldn't stop this ballerina from joining in. <eos> these tetris costumes were difficult to run in, but were a hit. <eos> a fireworks display was the perfect end to a great night.
the morning race was about to be underway. <eos> we received our bib numbers and waited for the line up. <eos> the crowds began to gather. <eos> by midnight the lines were already getting deeper. <eos> the fireworks went off to signal the start.
a strange tradition at my college is the fireworks-lit night race. <eos> it takes place during the winter, so everyone dresses warmly. <eos> fireworks go off all during the race---you can see everyone here is a little distracted! <eos> people dress up in strange costumes, to try to look like unlit fireworks. <eos> i love looking up as i run and seeing the big explosions!
there was a charity walk-a-thon last night. <eos> lots of people showed up to it. <eos> it had to be well over 1500 people total. <eos> some people even dressed up in weird costumes. <eos> after everyone finished, there was a big fireworks display.
a crowd is gathered together for new years. <eos> a man and woman wear headpieces for the new year. <eos> the group is gathered together for warmth. <eos> two of the people are wearing strange costumes. <eos> finally some fireworks take place.
during christmas, the oldest son of a family of 5 got socks. <eos> the mom got a book from one of her favorite authors. <eos> dad got a new keyring so he could stop losing his keys. <eos> the youngest daughter got some new baby clothes for her newborn. <eos> the youngest son got a new video game for the nintendo wii
i had a great christmas this year. <eos> my entire family received great gifts. <eos> i got everything that i wanted. <eos> and a new car. <eos> and my wife got me this shirt.
in keeping with christmas tradition, joey got underwear. <eos> sue got a book she wanted. knowing her, she'll have it finished before new year! <eos> phil did pretty well. his wife got him a car! i'm envious...but he deserves it. <eos> another tradition. i got a new pair of warm & snuggly pjs. <eos> i'm glad i got this picture of tom when i did, because immediately after this, he disappeared into his room to play the game.
we all got together for christmas again! here's my brother with yet more underwear! <eos> mom got a book from her favorite author. <eos> my uncle got some sort of electronic gadget. i'm sure he'll figure it out! <eos> my sister with some new clothes for her baby. <eos> joe with the new zelda game! he'll be bust for awhile.
its christmas time and everyone is opening gifts. this guy is not impressed. <eos> mom gets a book and is excited to read it. <eos> someone else gets a keyless entry key for their car. <eos> she gets pajamas and doesn't look too thrilled about it. <eos> finally he gets to open a gift and is excited to do so.
i was walking along the shore when i spotted a baby seal. <eos> it was awesome! i had to stop and take a picture of it. <eos> i tried to hide so that it wouldn't see me and run away. <eos> my dog saw the seal and wanted to approach it. <eos> the baby seal eventually crawled over to its parents.
one of the best things we saw the whole trip was the seals. <eos> the seals are a playful animal. <eos> we were doing a photo shoot when we came upon them. <eos> our dog had alerted us to them. <eos> we knew something when he came running up the beach toward us.
the walrus enjoys a nice day on the beach.  <eos> the eyes of the walrus pierce your soul, as if asking to come join you.  <eos> i had to hide far away in the bushes, so that i could capture the shots of the walrus.  <eos> my trusty companion is taking a break after running around at the beach.  <eos> my companion is running around the beach, and running away from the waves. 
a seal laying on the ground in the snow. <eos> the seal sees the cameraman. <eos> the cameraman takes a picture of the seal. <eos> a dog looks on at the seal. <eos> the seal nuzzles another seal laying on the ground.
alaska's outback is not to be compared. many area have never been traveled by humans. this seal doesn't seem to have any fear of man.  <eos> i can't believe i was able to get this close to her. i can see her black eyes and the cool air ascending from her breathe.  <eos> it's an eerie quietness out here but i love every minute of it.  <eos> my dog harry loves it too. he seems quite relaxed.  <eos> the area is full of walrus and seals. the shots i am able to get are amazing. 
i went to the museum last week. <eos> there were many strange robots there. <eos> they had some that looked like insects. <eos> others looked like animals. <eos> i spent a few hours there.
the team geared up for the science convention. <eos> they unveiled their new robot design. <eos> other teams showcased their projects as well. <eos> one team made a new type of remote car. <eos> this team won the most votes with their horse robot.
the technology exhibits were amazing, this one looks like its making lightning. <eos> this robot guy had a very interesting display. <eos> this spider robot was really scary, let's hope they don't take over the world and enslave us all. <eos> this horse-robot-thing was kind of funny looking, i wanted to jump on it and go for a ride, but i didn't want to pay for it when i broke it. <eos> heres the robot guy again, hes a little big to be a calculator, i wonder what his purpose is?
the students at ucla entered a robot competition. they planned their robot. <eos> they then built the robot. they made it look like a human. <eos> they got to the competition and waited their turn. <eos> whend it was therir turn they showed off their robot and won the competition. they <eos> they then got to keep the robot that lost to theirs. 
today we had a party at work.  <eos> my friend made a robot to serve us and entertain us.  <eos> we then played games with the robot.  <eos> the games was fun, but brutal.  <eos> the other robot was sad that he lost. oh well. 
i got to talk with some of the racers. <eos> this guy was awesome and we thought his hair was cool. <eos> there were people of all ages attending the event <eos> me pretending like i had won the race. <eos> had to get a picture with the sign before the day was over
signing up for a car race <eos> shopping getting ready for the race <eos> the cloud in the back ground watching the driver waiting <eos> stand by his car waiting to put on hellbent to get started  <eos> there is a murcia about bud wise jacket 
the guys got together to discuss their plans. <eos> he caught lobster.  <eos> the baby was prepared for the big day.  <eos> he was very supportive of the foundation.  <eos> we were excited to see the monument. 
last week i went on vacation. <eos> i had a great time diving and catching wildlife in the ocean. <eos> one of my friends brought their toddler along. <eos> we had a great time while we were there. <eos> afterward we went to do some sight-seeing.
mark decided to go on a trip to see some car races in miami. <eos> while there, he got to meet and greet some of his favorite professional race car drivers. <eos> he got to take pictures from the side of the track that was not open to just anyone. <eos> mark has had a love of race cars and car racing from a young age. <eos> at the end of the night, mark received a jacket from his favorite driver's sponsor. it was a great day for mark! 
the crowd starts to gather as the race cars start to pull up and prepare for the race. <eos> the race is about to start and the cars are lining up while the crowd cheers.  <eos> the cheerios car is off to a good start.  <eos> the bud car has pulled ahead of the cheerios car and is in the lead.  <eos> it is the final lap and the lowe's car is in the lead, the crowd goes wide. 
last week i decided to take my car to the race track. <eos> there were many other people there with their own cars out on the track. <eos> some of them were very fast. <eos> i had a lot of fun racing with them. <eos> i hope i can go back again soon.
a day at the races with my family. my favorite;#55 <eos> my dad likes car #19. rooting for different drivers makes the races exciting for my family.  <eos> my brother is a fan of car #21.  <eos> my mom likes car #44 she could be the biggest fan.  <eos> car #07 ended up the winner. well at least we had a good time!
i'd never been to a stock car race in my life until this weekend. my new boyfriend is a stock car racer, using car 55! <eos> i realized the race was a huge amount of fun to watch. <eos> it's cool how all the cars are covered with ads. it's strange, but a lot of fun to see. <eos> my boyfriend's arch-rival is number 44. he was glad when the officials stopped his car! <eos> the ultimate winner was number 97, who my boyfriend says is a very good racer. i'll be willing to go to more races in the future.
a race car takes off from its pit crew. <eos> number 55 race car waits on its crew to fix it up. <eos> a yellow cheerios car is in the lead. <eos> the red bud car is falling slightly behind. <eos> the lowes car is not far behind the cheerios car.
we decided to go to the market downtown. <eos> we shopped the wide assortment in the meat department. <eos> we ordered sausage with colorful toppings. <eos> the fried shrimp is always great. <eos> we also loved the architecture. we can't wait to come back. 
reading is one of the most important things a person learns to do in life.  <eos> we read to determine what's in our foods and how much they cost and weigh.  <eos> we read to find out business hours and days.  <eos> sometimes we even read to figure out where we are when we're lost.  <eos> reading can also serve to remind us of the important things we might otherwise forget. 
i went to the market last week. <eos> i was really hungry. <eos> i bought a delicious sandwich there. <eos> afterward i went for a walk. <eos> i found myself in chinatown.
my family took me on a trip to see the famous reading terminal marketplace. <eos> the market had a huge selection of exotic imported meats. <eos> i got to try a spicy sub sandwich with all kinds of exotic meats and cheeses on it. <eos> on the trip, we even found familiar food like fried shrimp. <eos> aside from the food, the architecture of the area was breathtaking.
the reading terminal market, let's see what they have in here today.  <eos> fresh sausages and i some of each time.  <eos> a hot sandwiches with greens on top, yum! <eos> in the restaurant looking out.  <eos> beautiful building and the colors flow lovely together. 
jerry loved being a jockey. <eos> but falling off his horse was embarrasing. <eos> he watched all the other horses and jockey's pass him by. <eos> he watched all the horses pass the finish line. <eos> he thought he was going to cry.
i got on the horse with my friend to practice around the track. <eos> however, we noticed that someone had fallen. <eos> their horse had also tripped over. <eos> we stopped practicing to see if she was all right. <eos> she seemed to be fine and just upset.
the horse races were so exciting today! <eos> one of the racers didn't make it over an obstacle and fell off his horse. <eos> it looked like he and his horse were hurt. <eos> the other racers got around him easily enough. <eos> he didn't have a very good race, he never did get back on his horse.
i went to the race last week. <eos> some riders who were injured. <eos> they were not moving. <eos> the other riders had to avoid them. <eos> they were okay in the end.
went to the horse race and right away there was some excitement as a jockey lost control. <eos> the rider and his horse were okay but you could really see his dissapointment. <eos> during a race like this the obstacles make winners and losers. <eos> this rider was having trouble coming off the jump. <eos> this rider who lost control earlierin the race was still there at the end. i felt quite bad for him.
the new honda was unveiled at the car show. <eos> it is very sleek and sporty. <eos> there were many models to help show off the car. <eos> the engine was newly designed for efficiency. <eos> this is a beautiful new automobile.
there was a problem with the car's engine and we needed a mechanic. <eos> we brought it to stacy who came highly recommended. <eos> she was not your typical mechanic. she used some sort of dance to fix the car. <eos> the engine magically started. <eos> we were able to leave and stacy dances off into the distance.
i finally got my new car today! <eos> i was so excited about my new car that i had to take photos for instagram. <eos> of course, i decided to do a sexy pose to get those likes up! <eos> after that, i did the sensible thing like check the engine and all that. <eos> now i'm ready to drive my car all afternoon! 
here is the newest honda car available for purchase. <eos> nevermind the girl in the short clothes, some people think this sells a car. <eos> here she is again, can we get to the car part now? <eos> here is your engine, looks good to me and ready to rev. <eos> here's a good back end and it's will definitely sell to me.

it was my two dad's birthdays today. my sister and i threw them a party.  <eos> ethel and bob came. they were the life of the party.  <eos> my little nephew fred and his dad bill played around the pool most of the time.  <eos> ethel and bob rounded everyone up and made a comical toast to my two dad's.  <eos> erica my niece kissed jack on the face and wished him a merry christmas! i don't think she knew it was summer time.

i now introduce a man who probably needs no introduction, mr. allen sampson. <eos> mr. sampson spoke movingly to the crowd about the need for better eye care in america. <eos> he listened well to the questions during the question and answer session. <eos> he did get a bit annoyed at some of the ignorance out there about glasses. <eos> this guy especially, with his wide-eyed stare, made mr. sampson a bit peeved.

oh how excited am i, i won tickets to meet these racers up close! <eos> of course, in meeting them, it would help if they were even slightly interested in meeting us. <eos> in all fairness, they need to focus on the upcoming race, driving in circles is hard core work. <eos> my bitterness faded slightly when i at least got these guys to pose for a photo. <eos> this is the final shot i took of the track before decided i'd proceed to my seat and hope for some wrecks.

this was the large stadium empty. <eos> some cars were lined up in front of the building already. <eos> this was the view from the goal. <eos> the building was slanted and appealed to the younger kids. <eos> the area was not well taken care of though.
felt like visiting memorial stadium today. <eos> had the whole field all to myself! <eos> the place sure does look grand. <eos> the size of it is even crazier when it's empty. can you imagine all those seats are filled so often? <eos> bless our beloved tigers.

tricycle racing is a lonely, stupid thing.  <eos> these people are the loneliest, but not the stupidest. until they mount their trics. <eos> this looks like a normal man with a hunger for the finish line. but much about tricycle racing is deceptive.  <eos> this is what a moment of glory looks like in this sport.  <eos> these people have come to face their mortality and the deep questions that arise from every true tricycle race. 
we arrived at the event <eos> everyone was talking about the events plans <eos> some people were wearing silly masks <eos> they were lots of people attending <eos> and even more showed up.

it did not seem to matter if the children played by them self on the playground. <eos> it did not seem to matter if they played in a group. <eos> what did matter was that when they sat and though, their play ground seemed to be missing something.  <eos> one day a girl invited an adult to play. it was the most fun they every had on the playground.  <eos> soon more and more adults were coming and having fun. the adults seemed to make their playground complete.

it's a great day for a soccer game. <eos> the teams are fiercely competing for the ball. <eos> two players collide in the battle for the ball. <eos> they watch in anticipation as they try to decipher where the ball is going to go.  <eos> this player saves his team with quick thinking, hitting it with his head to keep it from the other team.
sammy is doing really well in soccer. <eos> sammy is like a tasmanian devil with the soccer ball. <eos> sammy takes the game very seriously and will not let anyone else get in the way. <eos> the game was exciting and fun for everyone. <eos> there were no injuries but everyone took the game very seriously.
the triathletes finished their swim, ready to switch to bikes. <eos> the transition went smooth for most of the athletes. <eos> once on their bikes, they prepared to take off down the road. <eos> after the bike ride, the triathletes ran and hydrated. <eos> trophies waited for the athletes at the finish line.
swimming is the first part of the race. <eos> biking is the second part of the race. <eos> running is the third part of the race. <eos> a racer needs some water to keep going. <eos> the winners circle with medals and trophies.
the people took a swim before the race. <eos> they got on their bikes and began the race. <eos> after the bikes, they had to run on foot. <eos> number 90 was encouraged by a friend to move on. <eos> at the end of the race, the awards were handed out.
one of the triathlons events was swimming and despite the cold weather, everyone got in the water. <eos> they dried off as quickly as possible then got on their bikes and pedaled as fast as they could. <eos> when they were done biking they took off running, the sun was beating down harder and some had to use water to cool down. <eos> the participants started to return to the venue and look for food and water. <eos> everyone got a participation ribbon.
the water was cold, but it was still fun to run through. <eos> people had all the latest gear for the bike race. <eos> cyclists were ready to go and eager to race. <eos> everyone involved was competitive and excited. <eos> there were plenty of trophies, but those who didn't win still had fun.
the brochure for the race was interesting.  <eos> i saw this ball on the ground and it was very old looking.  <eos> the track was all ready for the race. <eos> the horses were all out practicing. <eos> they were even playing a bit before the race. 
we practiced for our figure skating performance this week. <eos> the moves are very hard to master. <eos> it took us several hours to get this routine down. <eos> we fell many times training. <eos> the end result was worth it and we look forward to the actual performance.
these two love to ice skate. <eos> the girl love to do tricks on the ice. <eos> she glides very smootly. <eos> the couple did a nice performance together. <eos> the couple did many tricks and show so much passion through their ice skating. it was a sight to see.
after the first two contestants finished their performance, lisa knew she had to try harder. <eos> lisa in her pink outfit started her first performance with an impressive one foot lap around the ice rink. <eos> she then landed in the center of the rink after a fantastic spin and ended her performance. <eos> immediately after lisa's performance the couple from earlier started their second attempt. <eos> they were very impressive while they held each other and spun around, but even this second performance didn't distress lisa.
a couple prepares for an ice skating dance together. <eos> first the girl shows off her skills in the rink. <eos> giving the audience a show, she displays her charm. <eos> now the couple takes the stage and steals the show. <eos> they dance together on the ice with ease.
fans watch the fireworks in the distance. <eos> many campers share a tent. <eos> friends visit from tent to tent. <eos> darkness has fallen and it's time to rest. <eos> it's the morning of the big game.
the organizers got their tents set up that day. <eos> they planned on what they were going to do. <eos> they unpacked all their needed supplies. <eos> then they got all the equipment ready to go. <eos> once it was all set up, and the clock struck 9, their firework display started.
families went camping near the beach and they watched the fireworks. <eos> people ate inside the tent. <eos> they also took the time to speak to each other. <eos> many families and friends stayed there overnight. <eos> mostly it was a successful event that went well into the morning.
for fourth of july weekend we decided to take a camping trip and watch the stars and fireworks from our tent. <eos> we had so much fun talking we almost missed the finale. <eos> we talked a bit about the show and also about the concert that would be happening in the same place the next day.  <eos> after the show and talking, we all turned in and called it a night.  <eos> we woke up the next morning to find that even more people had set up camp overnight !it was like a real festival.
fireworks made for a relaxing evening, after the crowds started growing. <eos> we tried hanging at the tent for the most part. <eos> most fans walked around chatting to pass the time. <eos> i had plenty of time to drop back and get a good pick, of our spot in line. <eos> even had so much time i was able to climb up and get an areal view.
the fans arrived at the basketball game. <eos> the dance team performed on the court. <eos> then the marching band played songs. <eos> the cheerleaders pumped up the crowd. <eos> joe paterno offered words before the game.

the school held a pep rally before the homecoming game. <eos> the dance squad's performance included high kicks. <eos> the band also played at the pep rally. <eos> the cheerleaders were also there to motivate the crowd. <eos> the coach spoke at the pep rally and predicted that the team would win the homecoming game.
the audience roared with excitement! <eos> the dance team did a performance,  <eos> then the band played a song. <eos> finally, the cheerleaders all led us in welcoming our team to the court! <eos> the coach was so excited, he couldn't contain himself!
wilford high had never won a game. <eos> so they decided to engage in a group martial arts tournament. <eos> they trained night and day. <eos> even the cheerleaders took part. <eos> in the end they broke records and won the heart of everyone.
i went to see my team, penn st. play for the title <eos> we have great athletes who can really jump.  <eos> the game was back and forth for much of the game.  <eos> we were up with the game almost over.  <eos> we won the game and celebrated victory. 
"marcus slam dunks another one! <eos> later on in the game marcus tries to retain control of the ball. <eos> he goes up for anther slam dunk. <eos> sam yells ""nothing but net!"". <eos> "they win the game and continue on to the championship.
the basketball teams were very physical during the playoff game. <eos> the point guard for the home team made a slam dunk. <eos> after that another player from the home team made a 3 point shot.  <eos> the home team celebrated the incredible shot. <eos> the fans went wild and celebrated after the home team won.
the day had finally entered it's second half. <eos> everyone was on pins and needles. <eos> the game was so close through every second of the game. <eos> but finally the momentum started to shift. <eos> and one team managed to come out on top.
the basketball player went for a slam dunk. <eos> he missed but still managed to catch the ball. <eos> then he went for another slam dunk. <eos> the ball went into the hoop. <eos> after that the crowd cheered.
autumn can only mean one thing, football! <eos> the bus is loaded and ready to go. <eos> the coach is excited and expects a great season. <eos> sportscasters line up and hand out predictions for the upcoming season. <eos> but most important of all are the players. they've been practicing all year for this moment.
i got vip tickets to see the superbowl. <eos>  they arrived in a luxurious coach bus. <eos> i got a chance to have a meet and greet with the coach of my favorite team. <eos> i also got to meet a few of the players. <eos> it wasn't until i saw the number 5 in my heart started to race, he was my favorite player of all time!
my dream of being on the football field finally came true. <eos> i got to have a tour if the players bus. <eos> the coach gave an awesome speech. <eos> i watched as they did interviews and got to see behind the scenes. <eos> but the best part was meeting all of the players.
football games draw thousands of fans every weekend. <eos> players are greeted with enthusiasm.  <eos> coaches do their best to spread team spirit. <eos> the media gather to discuss the games before they start. <eos> teams make their fans happy by providing team photos. 
the stadium was ominous as the playoffs loomed. <eos> the team arrived to an empty stadium. <eos> unfortunately, the opposition's coach was attempting to throw them off guard. <eos> the other team was rallying across the street from the stadium. <eos> "later, during a post game interview, largenberger said, ""they got us this time, but we will meet again!"""
our schools gymnastic meet was this week. <eos> many people were present and had a great time. <eos> everyone showed their best moves. <eos> it was an event for the whole family, where we raised funds for the school. <eos> the event was a real success and we plan to do it again soon.

kelly and christine love to hang out together. <eos> every saturday night they go to the springfield mall. this saturday they went shopping for a costume party. <eos> there were overwhelmed by all the choices; so they walked around the store to get some ideas. <eos> they were playing around in the the harry potter section when they ran in to their friend, bill. <eos> he said that he was going to the party as harry potter. christine decided that she would go as hermione and kelly was going to give everyone a laugh by dressing as ron.
the crowd inside the mall was huge that day. <eos> it was very easy to get lost in the madness. <eos> we met all sorts of strange people. <eos> we even got some temporary tattoos. <eos> we checked out and left the mob of people. 
janet and rain loved shopping. <eos> they loved the crowds and the deals at the local mall. <eos> rain wanted to get some bracelets. <eos> they both tried on some silly glasses for fun. <eos> rain's brother todd tried the same glasses on and bought them.

today was the big day. <eos> we got dressed up. <eos> then went out on the town. <eos> there weren't short on drinks. <eos> but they were short on skirts!
it was raining when we headed out to the game. <eos> we saw some of the performers when we got to the stadium. <eos> it was easy to get a drink before taking our seats. <eos> we could get snacks and drinks from the people in the stands, too. <eos> we had a really great view of the game!
last weekend was home coming weekend for our school. <eos> it was the weekend were all the alumni came to watch the games. <eos> everyone gathered for the reunion. <eos> they had a party with drinks and food afterwards. <eos> everyone was so happy to see each other again.
we took a trip to japan <eos> while there, we saw a ball game. <eos> we bought some beverages before heading to our seats. <eos> once in our seats, we saw some interesting fans! <eos> finally, the ball game started and we could cheer for the local team.
a group of students gathered together in the building. <eos> it is comicon and everyone is very excited. <eos> it is rainy and dreary outside. <eos> the staff quickly makes food and drinks for the people who are there. <eos> two girls are dressed as the same character.
the sky was starting to look a little gray. <eos> they all stood around looking at the sky. <eos> they decided to play anyways. <eos> the game was in full force and the sky was clearing. <eos> the first inning was over and the pitcher was practicing.
the friends went to the baseball game. <eos> the crowd was going wild as the pitcher wound up. <eos> everyone cheered when the mascot arrived. <eos> he jumped around doing all kinds of crazy stuff. <eos> the game came to a close as it got dark.
we are going to watch a baseball game today. <eos> the players are doing a great job. <eos> we even got to interact with the crowd. <eos> the mascot was great, and very funny. <eos> final score is here, what a great day.
storm clouds threatened the game, but we were all hopeful we wouldn't get wet. <eos> we got to sit really close to the players. <eos> the mascot got the crowd going. <eos> he likes teasing the kids. <eos> no rain! we made it through the night and won the game!
before the start of the minor league baseball game, fans were allowed on the field. <eos> families especially seemed to have fun. <eos> before too long, a few players came out and began to stretch out before the start of the game. <eos> eventually, that day's starting pitcher began to warm up. <eos> once he finished his throwing, the game would begin.
the registration process was as simple as it could get. <eos> it was great to run into my buddy dave. <eos> and i certainly took note of all of the sponsors that participated in the event. <eos> dave showed off his new golfing skills. <eos> overall, it was great to get out with the wife and do something that i enjoy for a change.
the two brothers decided to go golfing. <eos> they found the sign up table. <eos> there were a lot of other people wanting to golf to. <eos> the first brother took a swing. <eos> then the other brother took his turn.
setting up for the golf tourney. <eos> there was no way i was going to believe the stories these two guys were telling. <eos> these signs were everywhere, with all different sponsors.  <eos> the golf swing workshop was very successful.  <eos> it was definitely worth the money. 
sign up table for the charity golf game. <eos> two friends wish each other well before the game. <eos> one of the sponsors of the charity golf game. <eos> taking the perfect shot for charity. <eos> a couple play golf for a worthy cause.

here are all the flags of the country's taking part in the rally this year. <eos> here i am arriving at the rally.  <eos> here are the souvenirs i am going to keep from the rally. <eos> this is the rally safety car i drove this year. <eos> this is a picture of the drivers area of the car. i spent a lot of time sitting here, but it was worth it to be part of the rally.
this past weekend i attended the cyprus rally. <eos> i had to bring a bag to hold my gear. <eos> i received a bunch of free stuff. <eos> i saw the safety car. <eos> i got a closer look at the safety car. 
we went to the cyress rally this weekend. <eos> alot of countries were represented. <eos> they gave me this cool hat. <eos> i also got a special laminate rally pass. <eos> they also include an event program
i think a dirt track is the best place for cars to race. <eos> it reminds me of the old nascar days where dirt tracks were common. <eos> the track was challenging for some of the drivers.  <eos> it is not a real race without stirring up a little dust. <eos> the crowd definitely had a good time. 
the friends went to a car race. <eos> there were a lot of colorful fast cars in the race. <eos> a lot of people had come out to watch. <eos> the cars were close for first. <eos> it was the blue and red car that won.
the red car was in the lead as it rounded the corner in the annual rally race in town. <eos> next came the white, blue and green car, throwing up clouds of dust. <eos> right after it came a blue and white car that looked very similar to the white, blue and green car. <eos> in last place was the blue and yellow subaru as they headed into the finish. <eos> the white, blue and green car actually pulled ahead of the red car right before the finish and won!
there was an auto race out on the dirt track in the hill country. <eos> safety ropes were set up so the drivers knew where to go. <eos> people stood in the roads! i thought that was a little dangerous. <eos> if you stood too close you definitely got dirty! <eos> here comes the winner!
the race started. dangerous as always. <eos> the cars took no time flying and weaving around corners. <eos> people were standing out in front of the cars putting themselves in danger. <eos> the head car rounded the final corner. <eos> crossing the finish line, the fans went crazy and the race was over.
we thought we arrived early for the big book debut but apparently not. <eos> my friend was dressed in costume for the latest book in the series. <eos> we looked at all the other books waiting to get our hands on what we wanted. <eos> a guy their had the same glasses my friend was wearing. <eos> i finally got the book i came for after hours of waiting.
we went to a airplane museum. <eos> there were all kinds of old airplanes on display. <eos> we saw an old fashioned pilot uniform. <eos> this one was the son's favorite. <eos> the trip to the museum was a fun trip for all.
this is a seriously fast strong fighter jet plane for the military. <eos> this wheel is no good, no one should use this plane until the wheels are fixed. <eos> the propeller produces high mile per hour winds that can blow someone away. <eos> the propellers look small but don't let that fool you. <eos> this is a test pilot with all the gear on, let's fly.
the boy scout troop got to tour the local air force base. the boys loved seeing the fighter jets. <eos> they got to watch as one of them was serviced. <eos> everyone liked seeing the test dummy. <eos> the big hangar was beautiful. <eos> i hope the boys get to visit again next year.
we went to the aviation museum  <eos> we got to see alot of cool stuff. <eos> i saw authentic wwii stuff. <eos> as well as a stealth plane. <eos> i would go back again.
the family likes going to see the game. <eos> we always sit together in a big group. <eos> we don't always play with our food, but today we can't help it. <eos> our seats are high up in the stadium so we are glad for the big screen. <eos> thanks, dad, for the tickets!
bobby and suzie decided to spend the night watching a basketball game.  <eos> it was actually a surprise for suzie so she gave him a big kiss to show her appreciation.  <eos> they shared an order of delicious onion rings.  <eos> suzie's daughter called to see how they were enjoying things.  <eos> then it was time for the game to start in front of this packed crowd. 
janie went with her father to the basketball game. <eos> she loved spending time with him <eos> they found a surprise in their onion rings! <eos> the whole group was having fun. <eos> at the end of the night, they had so much fun watching the players.
looks like we're in the front row! <eos> the girls enjoying their time. <eos> look! an anti-onion ring! <eos> since we can't really see the court, we can at least watch it on the jumbo-tron. <eos> she's kissing me?!
we went to the game last night. it was absolutely packed.  <eos> but, as you see, we were all happy to be there.  <eos> we reverted to being children with the food.  <eos> the center court display was impressive.  <eos> all the couple there had a great time. 
today was the day. <eos> i was going to prove my theory. <eos> the theory that people are most closely related to lemmings. <eos> and the people didn't let me down. <eos> they all went over the edge!
everyone gathered around for the big red bull parade at the sea doc. <eos> there were great big red and white red bull signs and banners everywhere upon every boat. <eos> lots of people watched and listened to speakers come talk about a new red bull line coming out soon. <eos> some of the people from the crowd even got to participate in red bull contest on the red bull boat. <eos> everyone had a great time, and after the parade was over everyone got together for a red bull photo op.
the crowd watched as each of the contenders stepped up to the plate. <eos> the planes would fly from the boat and try to land successfully. <eos> one by one, they succeeded or failed. <eos> some designs were more ingenious than others. <eos> the last one almost tipped over the side.
we loved seeing all the boats. <eos> we were anticipating the next diver. <eos> we watched this guy fall face first in the water. <eos> we thought the stunts were amazing <eos> this place was crowded that we almost lost each other.
help! i'm falling! <eos> don't worry. i gotchu. o wait... <eos> are we just diving into the water now? i guess it's my turn! <eos> crap! the road ends here! <eos> noooooo. i'm falling!
we had a meetup at our local car garage this week. <eos> it turned into a cookout when someone brought their grill. <eos> everyone displayed their cars and we talked about different parts. <eos> a local mechanic showed us a few tricks and tips under the hoods of our cars. <eos> all the people in attendance enjoyed the day.
this past saturday the boys at all pro subaru decided to have a bbq while tricking out their cars. <eos> as the burgers grilled, the boys started on the cars. <eos> stan handled the new brake installations. <eos> while tom, mark, and jerry worked on the engine. <eos> little deb inspects the new build as the team moved onto the next car.
dad and i love cars.  <eos> the local dealership hosted a small car show and they cooked food on the grill. <eos> my favorite car was this blue subaru. it was beautiful. <eos> they even did an oil change tutorial. <eos> all of the cars were beautiful. i can't wait to get me a new ride. 
allpro cookout day. <eos> some coworkers enjoying some hamburgers and hotdogs. <eos> would love to see whats under that hood. <eos> check it out. <eos> lets pimp some rides!
the car show was awesome. <eos> we had a bbq while we waited for everyone to get there. <eos> my car was the favorite amongst those who gathered. <eos> we spent the whole day comparing engines and cars in general. <eos> it was the most fun i've had in months.
the dirt bike race was international  <eos> it was very exciting  <eos> the bikes go really fast <eos> the riders are professionals <eos> many guys come to compete
the racers unloading their bikes from the truck. <eos> the photographers ironically posing for a photo. <eos> two riders practicing before the race. <eos> the racers lined up at the starting gate. <eos> and they're off with a loud rumble!
my brother, billy, is a dirt biker. this weekend was his first race. <eos> it was so amazing seeing him in action. <eos> this was the first time that i had ever seen him on the bike and he did an incredible job. <eos> i wish that i was as talented as he is. <eos> everyone did a good job and i'm definitely going to come to these competitions more often. 
the motorbikes gather at the starting line as the race is about to begin. <eos> going through the hills, the motorbikes are going up and down into the air. <eos> a tight curve is coming up as the racer in green prepares for the turn. <eos> they make the turn successfully but are unable to keep up with the pack. <eos> the man in white is seen smiling as he wins the race.
the atv race was a tough one. <eos> racers from all across the globe arrived and pulled off fantastic stunts. <eos> stuntman pete was not deterred. <eos> he rode on, steady and slow without showing off. <eos> he got 2nd place but to get 2nd amongst the world's titans is still a feat!
paddy o'leary contemplates his next pint. <eos> he is so fond of the guinness, that he has it tattooed on his face. <eos> down another one, paddy o'leary! <eos> paddy makes interesting decisions when he has been drinking. <eos> paddy looks festive in the guinness crown.
saint paddy's day is special to ian since he's irish.  <eos> but lack of irish blood didn't stop anyone else from having a good time.  <eos> his sister moira had flown in from ireland and she was having fun as well.  <eos> but like i said, everyone did, irish or not.  <eos> then ian got all quiet and started quoting james joyce and things got weird. 
looking pensive the chap gazed as he was looking into a far distant land while sporting a clover on his left cheek. <eos> ever pensive the fellow stroked where a beard would be and turned his gaze revealing a painted beer glass on his right cheek. <eos> the first sip off the top to is always the best. the man enjoyed it with his eyes closed. <eos> keeping with tradition a friend painted her fingernails green and gold. <eos> an oversized hat is a good way to help keep the party alive.
sporting a green st. patrick's day hat, a man holds a stuffed animal, while his friend looks bemused. <eos> a guy is shown up close, grinning at the camera while wearing a tall black guinness hat. <eos> a woman chats with a friend over a meal during the festivities. <eos> more people gather together and converse while drinking beer. <eos> with his hair pulled back, you can clearly see the shamrock painted on the side of his face as he studiously poses for the camera.
it is the best hat contest and it is just starting. <eos> first competitor, has a black hat. <eos> the judge is impressed by the first contestant. <eos> some fools show up without a hat but they are allowed to stay. <eos> the winner strikes a pose.
today is the annual scottish pride parade in the city. <eos> men line the streets wearing their kilts with great pride. <eos> beer is a fun part of the scottish pride parade. <eos> this man is leading the troop of men playing their bagpipes. <eos> it was a rainy day but everyone still enjoyed the sights and sounds of scotland. 
we went to a rainy st. patricks parade. <eos> the highlight was the band of bag pipers. <eos> they were decked out with various socks and shoes. <eos> these were my favorite socks at the parade. <eos> this gentleman was wearing those socks.
the man wore a brave and bold uniform. <eos> his men followed him in respect. <eos> a man wore a cup costume and strolled around. <eos> the tradition was magical and i felt the culture. <eos> the men played bagpipe instruments.
only men can live in the world of guinnes. <eos> men wear skirts. <eos> men weird extremely cute ssocks. <eos> men wear skirts with extremely cute socks with cute fur hanging. <eos> we are men of guinness. we are proud.
we watched the pied pipers march in the parade. <eos> they all walked in step with one another. <eos> this guy was my favorite. he looked like a big mug of beer.  <eos> the pipers played heavenly music while marching.  <eos> they marched for many blocks while they played their music.
it was a big national holiday.  <eos> people were ready for san-patrick day.  <eos> even a performing band was in green colors.  <eos> people who didn't wear green that day deserved black and white photos. <eos> it was enormous crowd. 
dad was so proud of us, that his smile threatened to engulf his whole face.  <eos> we had made it to the big city. there i am, with mitch: isn't he darling in his suit? <eos> there's jim and his wife anita; i can't believe she didn't tuck her antennas in! that's just the sort of thing the humans notice! <eos> highly intoxicated, the irish king indicated he'd like two more beverages, while his mates posed with him for a photograph.  <eos> and there, deep in the crowd, a lone stranger held up a sign, trying to warn his peers, but to no avail. 
the crowd for st. patrick's day was so crazy. i had never seen it like that before. <eos> first thing i did was snap some pictures with the bros because there was no way i was going to remember the night otherwise. <eos> we got so wasted we decided to get on stage and sing ice ice baby. <eos> at the end of the night i found a hot babe to take home with me. <eos> it was a great night i think. i can't really remember anything.
a crowd has gathered outside to celebrate st. patrick's day. <eos> a group of friends takes a closeup photo, with the guy in a green beer stein hat taking the middle spot. <eos> a band dressed in all green takes center stage for the evening's entertainment. <eos> a young couple take a moment to themselves to pose on the sidewalk. <eos> once more inside, the party carries on for this packed st. paddy's day celebration.
the city's annual beer festival kicked on friday night.  <eos> this group of friends celebrated with green beer. <eos> a band came onstage to entertain the crowd. <eos> the couple enjoyed the festival but decided to make it an early night.  <eos> other people partied well into the morning with music, dancing and beer.
mr. stoker arrived in his grey passenger vehicle, adorned with custom plates and inane stickers. <eos> his faithful servants etched his sigil upon the sand, calling upon the powers of transformation! <eos> in a blink of a shutter, mr. stoker turned into a multi-colored dragon, riding the wind eddies of the cloudy sky.  <eos> but alas! the sun appeared, and burned him into a little black crisp. <eos> his no longer so faithful servants quickly found a holy building to purge their souls of his depravity. 
i thought i spotted something off in the distance. <eos> as it got closer i thought it didn't look like any bird i had seen in person before. <eos> then it got close and i could see it was a dragon. <eos> we were scared so we took a huddle to make a game plan. <eos> then it occurred to me to call the vampire. he would know what to do.
taking a tour in transylvania and we come across this. welcome home. <eos> the ancient writings shown here kept us occupied for a while. we still don't know what they mean. <eos> someone flying a dragon kite over dracula's castle was cool, but eerie. <eos> as the sun starts to set, we see a real bat fly over the castle. <eos> dracula's castle at sunset was amazing and scary. 
a somewhat menacing license plate... <eos> photo-op with the sidewalk art! <eos> strange creature flying through the sky... <eos> flying in the distance lit by the clouded sun. <eos> a beautiful cathedral on a beautiful day.
a group of friends and i drove to visit a church. <eos> when we got there we planned are day together. <eos> there was a bird flying in the sky that i have never seen. <eos> the day was sunny and cloudy at the same time. <eos> when we arrived at the church it was huge.
we started st. patrick's day early in the morning. <eos> even the dog was excited to be irish for a day. <eos> we crowned mary the irish princess. <eos> it was a fun, boozy day. <eos> "mark got all the girls to kiss him by saying ""kiss me, i'm irish."""
i had a great time at the party. <eos> we all played with the dog. <eos> i met a lot of new people there. <eos> there were many games that we played. <eos> some people had a lot to drink.
we stacked the tub full of ice and brews. the party just started with a bang. <eos> everyone got a round of beers and we all began to play drunk musical chairs. <eos> then there were two and the wasted chair throwing game was finally over. <eos> after the game we all got together and played kings cup. <eos> daniel made a rule that ended up working in his favor very well.
top o' the morning to you. it's st. patty's day, and we begin the day with a beer bath ... literally. <eos> later in the day, a bunch of maybe-irish, maybe-not-irish people gather to plan the day for st. patty's day. <eos> the group make their way to a bar and pose for pictures in their st. patty's day regalia. <eos> during st. patty's day, everyone is your friend. <eos> kissing - they're irish. or not. it doesn't matter because everyone is irish on st.patty's day.
lots of drinks for the st paddy's day party!  <eos> even the dog marnie had maybe a drink or two.  <eos> couple drinks in and james and martha are feeling quite cozy.  <eos> a couple more drinks and martha is hugging everybody.  <eos> not to be outdone though, nicole was out here kissing random guys. 
i went to the science fair last week. <eos> there were many different booths. <eos> i saw a lot of different equipment there. <eos> there was also a presentation. <eos> it was very insightful.
the seminar for self-help was a museum. <eos> the whole thing was bizarre. <eos> at least we got to see cool gadgets. <eos> some of the exhibits were really interesting. <eos> the actual seminar was a bust.
today we took an adult field trip to the most boring museum ever. <eos> they had exhibits of people just sitting around doing nothing. <eos> they also had a satellite which was random, but it was interesting to see. <eos> there was a faux classroom where we had to listen to a lecture. <eos> there was even an overhead presentation. 
i arrived for my first day of college and immediately i felt nervous. <eos> there were so many people and the building was so large it was all somewhat overwhelming. <eos> then i saw a familiar piece of technology that made me feel almost at home. <eos> class began and the nerves started working against me again. <eos> after a short while though i realized the curriculum was very similar to what i already knew making me feel at home once again.
students gather outside of the lecture hall before class. <eos> a different view is shown as the picture taker stands upstairs peering down at the mingling students. <eos> a replica of a ground satellite perches on a wooden stand in the corner of the room. <eos> class begins as the instructor speaks to the class while standing in front of the chalkboard and projector. <eos> information is shown on the overhead projector as students take notes.
the winter irish parade took place in december. <eos> the rain caught the people, but they had umbrellas to cover themselves. <eos> even the family pets joined in to the festivites. <eos> people had fun tooting their horns. <eos> the parade ended with a band playing old irish jigs.
the fair had lots of people in cool costumes. <eos> they were celebrating different holidays. <eos> even dogs were in on the fun. <eos> some people wore silly outfits. <eos> some people took it more seriously.
there were many posters brought to the event. <eos> there were plenty of green items. <eos> the dogs even wore green leashes. <eos> one fan brought a loud horn. <eos> some people gathered on the side.
the irish parade was covered in green. <eos> there was even a unicyclist. <eos> even the dogs were dressed in green. <eos> the whole town came out for the festivities. <eos> there was an irish rock band performing as well.
it was st. patrick's day.  <eos> performers rode unicycles.  <eos> some people even brought their dogs.  <eos> this man played a pipe.  <eos> some people even jammed out. 
we invited lots of friends for a barbeque. <eos> the fire pit was very large. <eos> we roasted hot dogs right over the flame. <eos> lots of people were happy. <eos> and there was a lot of beer too.
it was our first big backyard barbeque of the summer. we invited all of our friends. <eos> we all sat around and caught up with each others' lives. <eos> dave started the fire pit. look at those flames! <eos> everyone put hot dogs on skewers and roasted them over the fire. <eos> we all had a great time hanging out until very late in the night. it was a great party!
the family having a couple of drinks before our annual cook out always makes good memories. <eos> jim is always trying to blow something up. looks like he was definitely the man for this job. <eos> thanks to jim everyone can now relax by the fire and roast some hotdogs. <eos> my sister with the pyro maniac himself, jim getting ready to entertain us with karoke. <eos> my niece ang jim seem to be having some creative differences before the show.
one night, we were out at the new neighbors' place, and had a few beers and drinks while we waited for the food. <eos> the pit master, craig, ended up making a huge fire in a fire pit that he bought. he used some good wood that day. <eos> the spread was crazy, but i ended up sticking towards eating wood-smoked hot dogs. <eos> it was such a good time that i ended up meeting sarah. we ended up going back to my place for some coffee. <eos> cynthia was very excited that i had found a woman to suit my needs.
the group had a few beers before it was time for dinner. <eos> then they got the fire ready for cooking food. <eos> after that they roasted hot dogs over the open fire. <eos> the group was so happy to see each other. <eos> by the end of the night, everyone had a really good time.
the mood of this private party was jovial and quite cheerful. <eos> as you can see, plenty of refreshment was available. <eos> the party goers were all talking and having a great time. <eos> the party even included some video games for everyone to play. <eos> this game i found particularly interesting and challenging.
this is a party that a my friends and i went to. <eos> we all watched people playing video games all night. <eos> here are a couple people playing the games. <eos> this dog was too cute to not take a picture of him. <eos> we played some ping pong before heading home for the night.
friends gathered in the basement for a night of games and fun. <eos> there is plenty of alcohol for a good time. <eos> the friends catch up and start drinking out of blue cups. <eos> then the games begin on the television. <eos> the simple game keeps the party goers busy and occupied.
we had a party at the student center. <eos> it was a lot of fun watching the ballgame with friends. <eos> a few guys had video games going. <eos> our mascot got his dinner. <eos> ping pong was a big hit and much more fun than the video games.
trying to talk everyone into beer pong. <eos> seemed like everyone had already drunk most of the liquor. <eos> as more people showed up so did more drinks. <eos> by the end, we had started beer gaming. <eos> not to mention, it took five drunk guys two hours to find the oldest game system in town.
we were all prepared for the big game.  <eos> the players seemed to be having fun too.  <eos> but once they really began, there was a change in effort.  <eos> they even had a tiny guest star! <eos> i'm really glad i was able to get a picture with one of the players after it was over.
the city is busy with people. <eos> it is dark but the people are having a great time. <eos> the building outside the city is snowy. <eos> a small camp is going on inside for people to work on their football skills. <eos> they get to train with local football players.
ahh a night of good food. <eos> and outdoor activities while we enjoy our visit to vegas. <eos> the weather isn't spectacular. <eos> so we go to the nfl indoor field. <eos> it got crazy real fast there!
the family went to a local football game.  <eos> before the game, the kids played on the course.  <eos> everyone had a good time chasing each other.  <eos> one little kid had the ball, and made a touch down.  <eos> some of the players were kind enough to take a picture with us. 
we headed out on the town at night. <eos> it was lit up beautifully. <eos> we walked the town a lot during that time. <eos> we went to a few awesome exhibits. <eos> it got a little weird sometimes.
grandpa kept going to the drinks table for booze refills. <eos> when his grandson tried to grab a beer from the guest, they knew there was a problem. <eos> grandma took the boy to another room and called for help.  <eos> the next day they all attended the aa meeting.  <eos> at 30 days sober, jeb got a prize. 
superbowl sunday is a day when many people have parties.  <eos> friends and family gather to watch the game. <eos> it doesn't matter if their favorite team is playing or not, the game is exciting for everyone. <eos> people will stay glued to the television.  <eos> whether you have a large gathering or not, it can be a great time. 
it was dad's 74 birthday. <eos> almost all the immediate family showed up to celebrate.  <eos> uncle frank got a little to into the game. like always. <eos> it was karaoke time one of franks favorite games. <eos> when he started to sing everyone ran away. the driveway was gridlocked so many people was leaving.
uncle george was in charge of the drinks for the superbowl party. <eos> my siblings were all excited for the game. <eos> a missed pass had everyone groaning. <eos> almost everyone was absorbed by the game except mom. <eos> cousins robert and frankie were relegated to the basement because they were steeler fans.
dad, ready for the game, his face when i told him it was cancelled. <eos> caught little man trying to steal some drinks. <eos> mom done such a great job with the kids. <eos> the game was on, but the guys kept shushing us the whole time. <eos> they was fine after their team won.
brad is getting ready to have a few friends over to drink and hangout.  <eos> john is on his way to brad's to see some of his old college friends. <eos> some friends have already arrived and begun drinking. <eos> once the girls arrive they take some photos posing together. <eos> by the end of it all, steve is passed out in a recliner while everyone else has left.
the group took mushrooms <eos> they all got wierd <eos> everyone was having so much fun <eos> there was funny stuff happening <eos> but this picture is great
when we got to our friend's apartment we went into the kitchen to start developing some of the film for the pictures we took.  <eos> john apparently isn't a safe driver because he likes to take pictures when he's driving.  <eos> most of the pictures just showed the guys sitting on the couch hanging out.  <eos> their girlfriends must have gotten a hold of the camera and took some selfies.  <eos> one of our friends isn't very lively during parties and often times falls asleep. 
busted surfing porn.  <eos> they all laughed at him.  <eos> his girl friend didn't mind though, in fact, it turned her on.  <eos> she kind of liked this new friend he had brought over.  <eos> in fact, she liked him more than just a little.
the girl was in the doorway <eos> and the man was driving. <eos> the people were happy <eos> that they cuddled <eos> and the man was sleeping.
"my sister announced that she is engaged to be married. <eos> so our family got together... <eos> with his family to throw them a ""welcome to the family"" dinner. <eos> it was a huge success! wow our big family could actually get bigger? <eos> "i think the newly engaged couple were really surprised! here's to a long and happy marriage!
on st. patrick's day we whipped up a batch of green eggs and ham. <eos> then we cut our ham in the shape of clovers. <eos> it was a great breakfast to honor the occasion.  <eos> we then proceeded to the parade. <eos> the music was great, and the band did a great job. 
in the living room, there was a great atmosphere. <eos> my family met in the middle to take pictures. <eos> we all posed together in unison. <eos> the living room and the kitchen were open. <eos> we had a lovely event on that night.
the whole family met at their favorite restaurant. <eos> all of the brothers were excited to see each other. <eos> everyone was happy to get the whole extended family together. <eos> mom and her baby both ate a lot.  <eos> everyone had a fun time.
my family decided to my brother's graduation.  <eos> our cousins came over to watch movies and play games.  <eos> the lot of us ate lunch and took a family photo.  <eos> that was my brother as a baby being held by our mom.  <eos> at night our relatives left and we enjoyed a nice quiet dinner. it was a nice day. 
i put a lot of bacon on the turkey. <eos> i had to cook it for many hours. <eos> i also made sure to have some vegetables. <eos> i also included some citrus. <eos> the turkey turned out great!
we took the chicken out of the oven.  <eos> we set up a plate to serve up the chicken.  <eos> we cut the chicken in pieces to easier cut down.  <eos> we cut down the chicken to smaller pieces.  <eos> we served the chicken on the place of lettuce. 
we covered the turkey in bacon and put it in the oven. <eos> it came out perfect. <eos> we added some lettuce to the plate  <eos> with orange slices on top. <eos> then we cut the turkey up to serve.
"anything wrapped in bacon means ""delicious""! <eos> prepping the bird for slicing. <eos> a bed of green leaves to hold the delicious meat.  <eos> a little garnish for variety and flavor. <eos> "slicing the meal to come.
mary found a recipe for a roast chicken wrapped in bacon. <eos> the chicken was so tender that it fell off the bone. <eos> she decided to pair it with some romaine.  <eos> orange slices give the romaine a nice tangy taste.  <eos> now it's time to enjoy the meal. 
there was other food, but nobody cared. <eos> when the fruit basket was finally ready, she showed it to the family. <eos> grandma worked for days to prepare her famous fruit basket. she forgot to clean her apron. <eos> they were all so amazed at how beautiful it was. <eos> john was so happy he gave her a cold stare.
here is the spread of food before the party started.  <eos> we helped ourselves to the food, buffet style.  <eos> our chef made sure our wine was filled to the top.  <eos> we enjoyed our meal together on this holiday.  <eos> we opened presents, and i got a tree plate. 
we got the family together for christmas dinner. all the food was laid out. <eos> the family made their plates. <eos> mom filled up the wine glasses. <eos> it was nice catching up. <eos> we then opened presents.

it's a gathering for the fall birthdays within our family.  <eos> delicious cakes like this are crafted lovingly just for this purpose. <eos> we can't wait to eat them, and boy do they smell good. <eos> how good, you might wonder? so good that they're worth licking the air for in hopes of a taste! <eos> finally the moment that we've all been waiting for arrives, and it's time to dig in.
the dog was having an interesting time at the party. <eos> it had so many new people to interact with. <eos> it got in the way of some photos. <eos> and then became the subject of the photo. <eos> after a long day the pup sat down next to someone to sleep and get petted.
today is the day of the party. <eos> the cake was finally made and it was nicely decorated. <eos> the family finally arrived. <eos> the dog was part of the gift for the birthday boy. <eos> finally, the birthday boy cut the cake and then we went out to the club.

this day was a very special day, as someone was celebrating their birthday. <eos> the chocolate cake was sitting in all its glory, waiting to be devoured by the hungry guests. <eos> everyone gathered around to sing happy birthday and to eat some cake. <eos> afterwards, everyone decided to spend some time relaxing. <eos> but it wasn't long before people went back for second servings of the cake.
that night we saw beautiful fireworks. <eos> the sunrise was gorgeous the next day. <eos> then we even saw a shooting star. <eos> the sunset and the buildings was beautiful. <eos> we ended our night watching the sun go down.
we decided to travel all around the world. <eos> we started with the liberty bell in philly. <eos> next we were off to the mountains. <eos> the rocket museum was very cool. <eos> our trip ended when our car got struck my lightning.
fireworks lit up the sky as we left the town. <eos> we heard the bells ringing as well as others fled before the others could get them. <eos> we headed for the closest mountain range, that's where we were told the closest camp was. <eos> we listed to the silos and everything creak as the monsters attempts to scramble up them. <eos> we were trying to get there before the storm would hit.
the fantastic fireworks show wowed the crowd. <eos> sunrise on the canyon walls was nothing short of inspiring.  <eos> a streak of beautiful light flew across the night sky.  <eos> we had a spectacular view at sunset.  <eos> the clouds put on quite a show for us. 
we watched the fireworks they were so pretty. <eos> we went on a hike then on the mountain. it was challenging but fun. <eos> we saw a shooting star the next day. <eos> we also got to see historical sites. it was cool. <eos> at the end of the night we saw a wonderful sunset. we were all happy.
i took the train to go visit my brother. <eos> he was there to pick me up at the train station. <eos> we posed for a quick selfie before heading into town. <eos> in town, we saw an old man feeding a bunch of pigeons. <eos> later in the day, we went to the park and met some other people.
john had recently lost his job. <eos> john went to the park everyday.  <eos> he took the train and pretended to go to work. <eos> he would sit and feed the birds all day long while his wife though he was at work. <eos> when she found out he was lying she was very angry.
we headed to the park. <eos> we went to wellesley hills.  <eos> we walked along the side of the railway. <eos> we spotted an older man feeding the birds. <eos> after we posed for a quick picture.
sam was reluctant to leave the city to return home for thanksgiving. <eos> he arrived in his home town dreading the long family dinner ahead of him. <eos> sam wondered briefly about taking the train back into the city. <eos> sam began to relax when he saw the people from his small home town going about the daily routines he remembered. <eos> suddenly, sam's brother surprised him by arriving at the train station, and sam was very glad to be home.
we waited for the commuter rail to pull up to the stop. <eos> he couldn't believe how late it was. <eos> but he was happy to be with me. <eos> we took the commuter rail to a park where we saw a main feeding the birds. <eos> and then we went ice skating.
i put on some tunes to set the thanksgiving day mood. <eos> i preemptively set the table. <eos> i made sure the living room was clean for my guests.  <eos> then i learned how to cook real quick. <eos> i think it turned out great. lovely meal.
everyone though that grandma's recipe was passed down, but it really came from a book. <eos> she would spend hours mixing ingredients to the recipe. <eos> she heated the oven to just the right temperature. <eos> she served it up just how everyone liked it. <eos> the family cut it up and enjoyed the meal unaware of the lie grandma was selling them year after year.
i read over the recipe to make the perfect stuffing. <eos> i added all the ingredients together. <eos> then i set the timer. <eos> we served the food and added the gravy. <eos> after dinner we had my homemade pecan pie.
time to make a fantastic recipe. <eos> gathering and mixing ingredients is very important. <eos> music and cooking is always a great combo.  <eos> preparing the table for the delicious meal to come. <eos> nothing more satisfying than enjoying something savory you made yourself. 
we visited my aunts. <eos> her patio table was so decorated. <eos> the sitting area lookes like a great place to read. <eos> i read and relaxed for hours. <eos> at night we had a candle lit dinner.
the turkey was served for the whole family to enjoy. <eos> they devoured it like animals. <eos> next came dessert, which everyone enjoyed. <eos> after dinner it was time for a boring game of scrabble. <eos> the night ended with a dispute over a strange word in the boring scrabble game.
we set up the bird before we shoved it in the oven.  <eos> here is some sweet potatoes we are mashing.  <eos> here is the bird, cooked, in all its delicious glory.  <eos> we carved up the bird because we wer ehungry.  <eos> our desserts we sweet and out of this world.

we're expecting company so i attempted to make some food. <eos> i'm not a very good cook so i threw a large can of beans in a pot and called it a day. <eos> here i just dyed some whipped cream pink. it was a real challenge keeping it looking fluffy. <eos> ah finally, a well deserved drink after all that hard work cooking a feast. <eos> unfortunately, no one seemed very impressed with my cooking other than grandma there.

the family always puts together a huge feast for thanksgiving.  <eos> beans were made for guests who do not eat turkey. <eos> there were several sides and desserts to choose from. <eos> the host's daughter just turned 21, and it was the first time she could drink with the family.  <eos> grandma loves to tell stories during dinner to embarrass everyone.

mike decided to steal his neighbor's cat, mr. boots. <eos> mike's mom and sister stared in disbelief when he introduced the cat to them. <eos> mike had to force the cat to stay since it kept trying to run out the front door. <eos> mike made a salad for the cat, but he didn't realize cats don't eat lettuce. <eos> fed up with mr. boots' escape attempts, mike decided to lay on the cat to make him stay.
i had to take a lot of photos today. <eos> everyone wanted a picture taken of them. <eos> i had them all pose for the camera. <eos> there were also some children there. <eos> they were scared to have their picture taken.

amanda was surprised by the generous gift her parents gave her for her birthday. <eos> amanda was so excited to receive the camera she'd been dreaming of! <eos> she immediately used her tripod and timer to take a picture of her roommates but was dissatisfied with the light quality. <eos> when amanda took the camera outside and away from fluorescent light, she was amazed by the quality of her shots. <eos> capturing such subtle expressions on her subjects face, amanda's desire to be a professional photographer was renewed.
kayla was always the one to take pictures at events and get togethers. <eos> sometimes she would set up the camera's timer and get in the photo, too.  <eos> she was always good about getting the most thoughtful photo's of her brother, braydon. <eos> her favorite subject to photograph was her niece payton.  <eos> her is payton doing an activity and kayla is right there recording it for future fun1

julie came over to play a game with her kid and the dog. <eos> the two played an interesting game of monopoly. <eos> afterwards, everyone, who is dressed in red coincidentally, had some food. <eos> julie's ex and his husband had to lie down after eating such a large dinner. <eos> julie's ex then fell asleep after eating -- it was a large food coma indeed!
it's my brothers birthday today. <eos> we're having a birthday party. <eos> here i am with dad. <eos> here's my aunt. <eos> here's my brother. happy birthday!
the table setting was gorgeous for the party.  <eos> the little ones were hungry, and ready to eat.  <eos> we gathered around and gave thanks for what we were thankful for.  <eos> the little ones look goofy in their hats.  <eos> we sat around the table and enjoyed the great meal. 
today they were setting up for a birthday. <eos> it was her 2 and birthday. <eos> she got all kinds of presents from everyone. <eos> a whole bunch of people came to see her. <eos> they all had an amazing dinner and time together.
jenny was dressed in her nice red dress. <eos> everyone was happy at the party. they all had a good time. <eos> jenny and uncle bob wore hats were playing around. <eos> aunt patty was drinking a really big glass of wine. <eos> mom, dad and bobby were all on the couch with their hats.
little jenny wasn't happy about having to wear a dress for thanksgiving.  <eos> she started to cheer up as more family members came over, and they all made turkey hats to wear. <eos> jenny laughed and laughed as her dad pretended to be a real turkey. <eos> mom got a little tired of the game and broke open a bottle of wine.  <eos> their neighbors played along, too, and made matching hats.
an amazing evening with guests gathered around having a laugh and drinking beer.  <eos> the smell of roast was in the air and the chicken was cooked just right.  <eos> as you can see she was impatient to try some of her own delicacies.  <eos> there were plenty of drinks to go around and it kept peoples spirits up while the food was getting ready.  <eos> after it was all prepared, guests sat around the table enjoying their food and evening. 
here's one of our thanksgiving turkeys. <eos> our family always gathers around to talk at thanksgiving. <eos> here is the other turkey. <eos> we gather around a huge table of great food. <eos> best of all is my uncle's home brewed beer.
my dad decided to smoke the turkey for thanksgiving this year. <eos> most of the family gathered in the living room to watch tv. <eos> this was the bird after it was finally done cooking, yum! <eos> we had an informal dinner that was almost more of a bbq, but we all loved it. <eos> nothing better to finish off a great dinner than a very good stout, cheers!
the turkey is done and ready to be cut. <eos> everyone sitting and waiting on the food. <eos> getting ready to slice it up. <eos> food and drinks on the table. <eos> a glass of beer looks really great.
the family gathered for a traditional thanksgiving day party. <eos> the turkey was basted and laid out on the table for all to enjoy. <eos> sheila couldn't help but sneak a quick taste before we sat down to eat. <eos> cold drinks waited for us as we took our seats. <eos> a beautifully set table, delicious food, and memories were shared by all!
the new baby was brought to the new house to visit. <eos> the parents relaxed on the couch while the kids played. <eos> the brother bonded with his new sister. <eos> after we had some more wine <eos> and grandma read the baby a new short story.
it's fall and mom and dad are here to see our newest baby. <eos> here i am with my new one. <eos> here is my brother with our pride and joy. <eos> here's my dad with one of his grand babies. <eos> dad looks happy but what about my boy?
the family has the newly born baby. <eos> they are very happy to have a baby. <eos> all the people love him very much. <eos> the child is very shy and do not like to have pictures. <eos> the family is taking pictures of his son.
baby jimmer came over for the first time to his grandparent's house. <eos> the grandparents felt a little weird since they were so young but welcomed jimmer. <eos> the other grandchild pretended to change a diaper but then changed his mind. <eos> so the grandparents changed the diaper in the kitchen for real. <eos> after jimmer had a clean diaper, his mother read to him from a picture book.
jeffrey loves to sit in dad's lap <eos> he was easily distracted by his toys <eos> dad caught some of the game while jeffrey worked on some new teeth <eos> his brother michael got upset that jeffrey had all the camera's attention <eos> he did a great job of playing it up!
at the antique shop, a dog was standing next to an old sofa. <eos> the sofa was rather small and it had an unusual covering. <eos> the covering showed old covered bridges in autumn. <eos> it also showed old windmills and it was very pretty. <eos> i reached into the sofa and found an old coin buried in between the cushions.
i reupholstered our old sofa. <eos> i picked this beautiful rustic design. <eos> this reminds me of a bridge where i grew up. <eos> and this looks like a well at grammy's house. <eos> our dog doesn't even notice the new upholstery.
i visited my grandmas house recently, her dog fritz was happy to see me. <eos> i was obsessed by this old wide chair that i had sat in so many times over the years. <eos> some of the images on the chair showed many cool things like this wooden bridge.. <eos> or this old school windmill, i never really paid attention to these before. <eos> as i bonus i even found this old coin, i'm not sure what it is, so it is off to do some investigating, what a cool old chair.
today the family bought a used couch. the puppy is checking it out. <eos> everyone decides the couch looks great in the office. <eos> they like the couch because it reminds them of the covered bridges they saw on their trip to new england. <eos> they also like that the windmill designs remind them of their trip to denmark. <eos> the children found an old coin in the couch! everyone was excited.
i bought an old chair at the tag sale. <eos> it was more of a couch than a chair, <eos> there was a rustic barn photo on the print, <eos> there were windmills too. <eos> there was a quarter in it!
we took a trip to the mountains. <eos> we say a large beautiful building. <eos> we snapped a few shots before heading back. <eos> we all got together for a large dinner <eos> and shared some laughs with some wine.
it's a gorgeous day to be outside. <eos> we're enjoying the sights and the peaceful atmosphere. <eos> the fresh air is a wonderful addition, and we can't get enough of it! <eos> moving further away adds to the serenity and doesn't diminish the regal beauty. <eos> the clear water lapping at the shores adds a harmony with nature that never gets old.
my wife and i visited a small villiage on the danube river in europe. <eos> this was her, i keep telling her to smile bigger with no luck. <eos> although i didn't do much better, even with the great scenery. <eos> this shot from up the mountian of this local town was highly impressive. <eos> the river was so peaceful and calming, we plan to head back again soon.
in early fall, as the leaves were at their peak <eos> i decided to go to a quaint mountain town for vacation <eos> i brought my boyfriend <eos> and we stayed at a resort overlooking this beautiful mountain <eos> at the base of the mountain was a beautiful clear lake. we had a great time!
going hiking and looking at the wonderful view of the mountains. <eos> i love the castle behind all the trees. <eos> here i am standing by the mountains. <eos> it's party time, let's get something to eat. <eos> a couple of friends having a drink.
i decided today would be the day i was going to conquer my fear of roller coasters and go on the mantis. <eos> i thought reading all the safety checks would help ease my fear but it didn't. <eos> this is no ordinary coaster, here you can see where it loops around upside down. <eos> this is the scariest part, you go straight up then free fall down backwards. <eos> this is the bush i threw up in after i got off the coaster, and no i didn't conquer my fear.
we drove next to the train. <eos> then we found mantis. <eos> it seemed really dangerous at the park. <eos> so we hid under an umbrella. <eos> i sure hope this isn't poison ivy!
this looks like a scary ride. <eos> safety rules must be folioed at all times at the amusement park. <eos> this ride looks like a colorful sculpture in the sky. <eos> the people on this scary ride must be very brave. <eos> the park has pretty gardens for those who don't care for the rides.
we decided to go to the amusement part for the day. <eos> the kids were able to pass the regulations and go on the rides.  <eos> some of the rides were very loopy.  <eos> or even downright scary.  <eos> and littering the ground, all over the park, were these strange-looking plants. 
riders enjoying the day at cedar point. <eos> reviewing the safety guide at the park. <eos> what an amazing water slide at the park. <eos> a very odd roller coaster in the park. <eos> foliage on the grounds of the park.
on the city street, it is rainy. <eos> we escape the rain in the train station. <eos> this is where we see the amateur dancers on the platform. <eos> they prove that break dancing is still popular. <eos> here is one of the dancers in his home environment, happy to be out of the rain.
we decided to take off and go to the mercedes-benz show room. <eos> the white car was without a doubt my favorite model. <eos> we even got to see the motorcycle's they are working on. <eos> the red car was awesome and very expensive. <eos> inside the car was amazing and i felt like i was in the future.
the new york bridge stood above them as they visited it. <eos> they moved through the subway trying to get to their destination. <eos> they got to the dance contest, just in time. <eos> they watched people dancing all night. <eos> they finished off the night by finding these tiny drawn robots in a window.
i was walking down the pier yesterday, admiring the bridge. <eos> when i went to catch the subway i noticed a gathering nearby. <eos> there were a lot of people watching some street performers. <eos> they were very good. <eos> afterward i left and got on that subway.
it was a rainy day in the city, but beautiful.  <eos> the subways were surprisingly quiet.  <eos> which made the large crowds at the dance-off startling. <eos> the dancers were incredible though. <eos> at the end of the day, we were happy to have gone. 
we set up the birthday banner for dad's party. <eos> joking around, he put on his lion mask. <eos> we sang happy birthday to him <eos> and he blew out his candles. he wouldn't tell us his wish. <eos> after he opened up his gifts while still wearing his lion mask.
i threw a birthday party for my dad last week. <eos> he was very surprised! <eos> even the dogs were happy for him! <eos> the children all spent a lot of time on their gifts. <eos> they turned out great.
it's dads birthday today. the family spent a long time decorating. <eos> the family has gotten together to celebrate this occasion  <eos> dad likes the gifts he has received and the dog appears to be in on the festivities  <eos> the kids have gotten dad some more presents and he's opening them. <eos> dad shows off the card his two sons made for him.
the banner is put up for the birthday party. everything looks good. <eos> grandpa looks scary in his mask. hope he don't scare anyone. <eos> everyone is sitting down. we are all ready for cake. <eos> grandpa is blowing out the candles. boy he is old. <eos> grandpa is checking out his presents on the couch.
grandpa walked into his birthday surprise. <eos> we made him wear a mask to get in the spirit. <eos> we presented the cake to grandpa. <eos> grandpa blowing out his candles on the cake. make a wish! <eos> little johnny gave grandpa his gift bag. no pants needed!
it is the start of a national rose competition and sarah is judging. <eos> sarah makes her way past many different roses but comes across one that looks spectacular. <eos> she knows that, as a judge, she must examine each rose thoroughly. <eos> sarah dips close and examines each rose keeping an eye out for wilted petals and other abnormalities. <eos> she even takes out a magnifying lens and realizes that this rose is absolutely perfect. sarah gives the rose the highest score.
i bought some roses today. <eos> they are very beautiful. <eos> i also bought a vase to put them in. <eos> i placed them on my desk at home. <eos> i smell them every time i sit down.
i filled the vase up with water. <eos> i added the roses to the vase. <eos> i put the in at a time.  <eos> they were fully bloomed. <eos> and the perfect red color.
i started a project to start growing flowers. <eos> this is the first set of flowers i grew. <eos> you can see the great petal formation here. <eos> if you look close you can see the great pigmentation. <eos> i was very happy with the result of the flower everyone liked the.
there was a symbol on the flower pot. <eos> the flower pot held a bunch of roses. <eos> the roses were very red. <eos> each rose looked slightly different. <eos> this rose was much fuller than the others.
today we decided to take a hike. <eos> we wondered into a town an saw some nice iron work. <eos> there was also an abandoned building with a freight elevator. <eos> during the hike we saw a gorgeous waterfall. <eos> we then walked across a scary rope bridge.
i went out into the city last week. <eos> there were many interesting sights to see. <eos> some of the doors were marked dangerous. <eos> after i left i decided to head out of the city to see a waterfall. <eos> the bridge to the falls was very narrow.
today was the day. <eos> out big sightseeing trip. <eos> it was dangerous. <eos> there were waterfalls. <eos> and a super cool bridge.
here we are stopping for a rest <eos> trying to figure out what this is, but it's amazing. <eos> i wonder what is behind here. <eos> loving the waterfall in woods. <eos> walking across the bridge to get tot the other side.
the happy couple met up in the afternoon to grab lunch downtown and head out on a hike. <eos> the architecture and details at the restaurant were ornate and beautiful. modern, yet had classic elements mixed in.  <eos> the building itself was a very old building, which had one of the very first freight elevators in the city. <eos> after a couple miles of moderate climbing, the couple found themselves at the beautiful cascading waterfall. <eos> the couple enjoyed the swing bridge over the river canyon below. 
there was a ton of snow on the ground yesterday. <eos> i went to the park to walk my dog. <eos> he was very excited to see all of the snow. <eos> there was a lot of graffiti in the park. <eos> after we played for a while i walked my dog back home.
frank was in his home when he was suddenly inspired to release his inner artist. <eos> he left out his home and petted his dog knowing that he had to travel a long way to find the perfect spot. <eos> after walking for about an hour, frank's anticipation had peaked as he saw the perfect spot to start his graffiti work. <eos> his first drawing was just a warm-up. frank tested his sprays and cracked his knuckles for his masterpiece. <eos> frank spent some time but finally finished his favorite graffiti work of all time. tired from all his work he was not looking forward to his long walk back home.
we were off work because of the snow, so we took a walk.  <eos> there was some spraypaint on a nearby building. <eos> the dog loved it. <eos> more tagging on a fence. <eos> the cold air felt good.
it had snowed, but the dog needed to be walked. <eos> there was graffiti outside. <eos> the man stopped to pet his dog. <eos> the two passed by more artwork. <eos> they were nearing home now after the long, cold walk.
the man is out for a walk after a fresh snow fall. <eos> he notices some odd graffiti on the walls of the coffee house that he visits often. <eos> he stops to pet a dog. <eos> he continues on his walk only to notice more graffiti on the fences surrounding the school. <eos> he walks back through the forest to emerge on the pathway behind his home.
sargent corpral was recieving an important medal today.  <eos> after he got his medal, some of the officers wrote it down in the big book. <eos> then he had to be interviewed for the military tv show. <eos> he talked about how he had won the medal and what it meant to the people. <eos> the news reporters were very impressed by his story. 
one soldier adjusts another's formal fatigues. appearance is important, especially when going before the committee.  <eos> the members of the committee also needed to prepare, and are feeling relaxed and attentive.  <eos> deckard salutes the esteemed members, showing his respect for them, even though they're all desk jockeys, while he saw real action in the arabian theatre.  <eos> deckard testified to the committee for hours, exhaustively explaining why putting decapitated pow heads on stakes was necessary for morale.  <eos> after careful deliberation, the committee agreed unanimously to recommend to the commander that new sops should specify decapitation for all. 
i helped pin a medal on my best friend's lapel before the interview. <eos> our commanding officer then went over some questions with him and other candidates. <eos> they were then ushered into a room filled with commanding officers. <eos> they had to then explain why they deserved the promotion. <eos> the officers then went into a side chamber to decide who would get it.
we got dressed in uniform for the debriefing. <eos> the officers asked there questions of me and i answered. <eos> i said my piece and took a seat. <eos> they did what they always do and told me how it is. <eos> i said what needed to be said and left the room.
there is no prouder ceremony than a military pinning ceremony. <eos> once my son was pinned, he got to sit in on high level briefings. <eos> he held a far higher post than he used to. <eos> it came with a lot of grilling from his superiors. <eos> however, they decided they liked him, and he rose in the ranks.
i finally enlisted in the army.  <eos> we are learning all types of things. <eos> i can now even work on machines.  <eos> and i have met a lot of good people.  <eos> my favorite part is the march at the end of the day. 
these men are hard workers and are trying their best to get ahead in life. <eos> they work on a car engine trying to get it to work correctly. <eos> the men dig and pick at the ground trying to get it flat. <eos> they also clean their guns and make sure they have ammunition. <eos> they are ready for whatever the day brings.
the major signed the shipping receipt. <eos> they started to assemble the generator. <eos> final inspection of the generator. <eos> the major and his soldiers. <eos> they marched thru the town in a show of peaceful force.
we listened attentively to the presenter. <eos> we then worked on fixing the device. <eos> it was easier working as a group to fix it. <eos> we made sure to patrols as well. <eos> we then trained as a group.
field operations can be very stressful. <eos> it's a lot different than office work. <eos> we are constantly dealing with equipment that breaks down a lot. <eos> we are out talking to the villagers and trying to help them. <eos> and yet there is still marching, lots and lots of marching!
i went to the local baseball game, halfway in we still hadn't seen any action. <eos> people were growing restless, and a few even left. <eos> all of a sudden a pitch like nobody had ever seen was thrown. <eos> the batter managed to hit it out of the park. <eos> after that the game had everyone's attention. 
it's time for our drum circle.  <eos> we like to think our drumming grounds us to mother earth. <eos> some ladies use a little flair when they play. <eos> others take the more straight forward approach. <eos> our ladies drum circle dances to the beat of our own drum.
frank found the baseball game so boring that he decided to read a book instead. <eos> others in the crowd also seem to grow bored during the game. <eos> the pitcher prepares to get an easy out with this next pitch. another perfect game for him. <eos> suddenly, a huge hit sends the ball soaring. a home run! <eos> the play revitalized the game and frank put down his book to see the rest of the game.
the town was hosting a local baseball game. <eos> every one came to cheer their local team on. <eos> most of the people got really into it, rooting for the team. <eos> when the local team hit a home run, the whole audience cheered. <eos> at the end of the day, even though the team didn't win, every one had a good time watching.
the crowd arrived to watch the baseball game. <eos> everyone was excited to watch the game. <eos> some of the people had to sit in the back of the crowd. <eos> the person at bat was able to hit the baseball. <eos> the out fielder caught the pop fly.
the fight was on. <eos> this is war. <eos> we have landed. <eos> time to dominate. <eos> we will not lose.
the army received special orders to save their country. <eos> they used a helicopter, <eos> to get their location. <eos> they blew up their enemies with a large gun. <eos> then came home victorious, saluting each other as they returned.
the helicoptor had a group of soldiers in it. <eos> this soldier is using the machine gun. <eos> once the helicoptor landed everyone had to get out. <eos> these soldiers are getting orders from their commander. <eos> once everyone got their orders it was time to head out.
a nations military is a powerful asset. <eos> the military is a force of protection <eos> and also can provide aid to those that need it. <eos> they are an extension of their nations government <eos> and work as a team to be the best that they can be.
the helicopter flew in, bringing the new soldiers with them. <eos> a man armed the turret, even though they'd never seen use. <eos> the new group stepped off the helicopter, finding their way to their new homes. <eos> the sargent gave a debriefing as soon as the soldiers arrived. <eos> this would be their new home now, the start of their new lives.
these two woman finally got a chance to meet. <eos> they collaborated about possible future business relationships.  <eos> then they gave their speech.  <eos> and met some good people.  <eos> before they left they got a group picture. 
it was an exciting moment to meet hilary clinton. <eos> with her secret service we walked from the plane to a waiting limo. <eos> and together we did even more waiting. <eos> and, of course had some discussions. <eos> then she gave her speech. she was really just so wonderful
hillary clinton arrives for a meeting with supporters. <eos> ms. clinton and some supporters meet privately. <eos> the lady in blue seems to be in charge. <eos> a local dignitary shakes hans with the candidate. <eos> everybody wants to be photographed with hillary.
mrs. clinton went on a tour, visiting different politicans and people. <eos> she talked with her staff, and discussed her plan to run for the presidency. <eos> she even gave a speech, to inspire her supporters. <eos> she met some more politicians, and people loved seeing her. <eos> at the end of the day, she met with her supporters, and they got to talk to the person they wanted to be president.
hilary came to visit. <eos> here we are waiting in the lounge. <eos> the event is about to start. <eos> she is shaking hands with a local politician. <eos> the event was a huge success.
was headed to my friends house and noticed the sky looks alittle cloudy.hope it doesn't rain. <eos> while we waited on some food to start cooking we had a couple drinks. <eos> after the drinks it was about time to start preparing the other dishes.so we chopped and cut some vegetables. <eos> unfortunately we burnt dinner and ran off to the bathroom to put out a small fire.the kitchen sink was full of dishes. <eos> after ordering take out food, we decide to watch sports on tv because it started raining like i thought it would earlier.overall it was a great time with friends.
jill grew up in a poor rural community.  <eos> she had big dreams though and plans to match.  <eos> jill dreamed of the day she'd have plenty to eat.  <eos> one day she planned to live in a fine, big house.  <eos> so, she went to work and worked hard until she earned the things of her dreams. 
i got to go on a mission trip. <eos> we helped mentor youths. <eos> the food was new to me, but very good. <eos> this is where we stayed. <eos> we had meetings each day to go over what we wanted to accomplish.
i went to my friends place to visit him. <eos> he had some drinks for us. <eos> we had a great time there. <eos> we burned some of the food. <eos> afterward we played some video games on the t.v.
here for the dream project. where we build homes and help feed and cloth people. <eos> this is our poster. <eos> some of our awesome food. <eos> these are some of the buildings where people get haircuts and clothes. <eos> here, they teach job placement skills.
everyone gathered for a nice night out. <eos> great music was heard throughout the night. <eos> so many yummy treats to try. <eos> the local team was well supported. <eos> now off for a good lunch the next day.
during our trip to the city, we decided to go to a club. <eos> the atmosphere was pleasant and the people were so friendly. <eos> the stage was ready for the musicians to play, all we needed was for them to show up. <eos> eventually they did, and they put on one of the best shows i have ever seen. <eos> to wrap up the wonderful night, we decided to treat ourselves to dessert.
the bar life is unique. <eos> there's almost always good music. <eos> if you are looking for good food, you can count on it being there. <eos> sometimes live musicians play and you get the opportunity to meet them. <eos> there are plenty of bars around the world and they are all unique in their own way.
the bar was not very full, but the band was hopeful that more customers would come in. <eos> the people outside were not sure whether they wanted to go listen to a band or not. <eos> the instruments were all ready to make their music. <eos> the band decided to begin, even though there weren't many customers around. they loved to play their music. <eos> a sweet dessert sat untouched on a table as the bar patrons found themselves entranced by the music.
today my band played live. <eos> we are such a fun group to be around. <eos> one our fans even made us food. <eos> another fan made us a t shirt. <eos> we will play anywhere and everywhere.
they arrived at the park and were finally able to see the caverns. <eos> they entered the cave and were immediately amazed. <eos> the glimmering caverns were beautiful. <eos> and, they also appeared to be very dangerous. <eos> and, it appeared they saw a bat, and tammy was deathly afraid of bats and she quickly left the cave!
we pulled up to the resort which was nestled in the beautiful mountains. <eos> we got settled and then started to explore the local caves. <eos> the stalagtites were impressive. <eos> we crept deeper and deeper into the cave. <eos> the view from deep in the cave was magical.
a beautiful lodge marked the location of a deep cavern. <eos> the cavern was dark and vast. <eos> there were a variety of chambers with interesting rock formations. <eos> one room was full of stalactites. <eos> another had an interesting bumpy pattern.
we went to a really old house today.  <eos> we found a creepy door to a basement and went inside. <eos> there were huge caverns underneath the house.  <eos> some of the scenery was beautiful. but chilling. <eos> we decided we needed to leave after we started hearing moaning sounds from inside.
growing up in a isolated town near the mountains, caving was a natural interest.  <eos> caves are a beautiful mysterious place to a kid.  <eos> i thought all the crevices and platforms had a story of their own if a person could only hear.  <eos> sometimes i thought i might see and elf or troll jump out from behind the stalagmites but i never did.  <eos> even though the rock formations are still fascinating, today i realize what a dangerous play space i enjoyed. 
these are the back of the packages i have. <eos> some tell a story and others don't. <eos> these are some wallpapers i like for my computer. <eos> this scene is really cool. <eos> the colors in this one really stand out on my computer.
me showing you guys how to play a game <eos> here i am showing you how to dress my characters. <eos> now i am showing you my super powers. <eos> now i am in battle with the enemy. <eos> my world that shows my house.
there were alot of toys to choose from. <eos> some were games and some were action figures. <eos> my granson really liked this one. <eos> we bought this one. <eos> we also bought this one.
got my latest copy of galaxy force. i know how to read asian <eos> this magazine is filled with lots of colorful anime. i love getting these. <eos> this issue shows alot of tranformers. we're going to see this movie soon. <eos> all are headed toward the sunset. <eos> where they'll battle.
i found this magazine on gundam type collectibles at a thrift store.  <eos> here is some of the terrific detail of some of the robots that it'd be really cool to find.  <eos> i like how the magazine went with different colors for different pages instead of just showing the same thing over and over again.  <eos> the magazine also had some fold out posters that you could add of cartoon versions of the robots.  <eos> i think i'll probably give this one to my nephew to hang up. 
robotech toys! you can build them into different things. <eos> this one is a space ship. <eos> or you can change it and make him a fighter. <eos> then into another space ship...all from the same parts. <eos> different things listed on the back of the package.
robotech has been around for a while. <eos> the have many different sets to purchace. <eos> you can get fighter jets. <eos> aircraft jets are also available. <eos> the robotic fighters are pretty cool.
lego instructions are really helpful for kids who are learning to build. <eos> the planes are a favorite- they often hold missles or have large wings. <eos> kids also like to build robots and transformers. <eos> the biggest spaceships are difficult to build but are really cool. <eos> instructions help kids build some really exciting models!
robotech released their new toy, with complicated instructions.. <eos> after putting it together, you could finally get a cool ship to fly around. <eos> you could also turn it into a robot with a weapon. <eos> if you wanted to change it even further, you get an even cooler ship. <eos> there were so many different options for the new toy.
i opened the instructions to put it together. <eos> front page showed the finished product. <eos> the next was it in another form. i was now lost. <eos> then another one came up. <eos> by the time i got to the last page, i gave up.
"robosaurus was orange and viscous, and ready to battle.  <eos> the omnibot jr. clenched its cup holders, trembling in fear.  <eos> mr. d.j. slide into frame and told omnibot jr., ""i'll fight by you!"" <eos> and then, all the robots picked a team and played the world cup fusball.  <eos> "afterwards, they broke open a water starball and quaffed the water, to the detriment of their circuits. 
billy bear and his sister, betty bunny, were very lucky children with wonderful toys. <eos> betty had a fully furnished doll house with a whole family in residence. <eos> billy had a terrific train set that went round and round, complete with a nearby town.  <eos> both of them enjoyed playing with the ordinary robot.  <eos> but by far the favorite toy that the children enjoyed was monster robot dinosaur!
i was looking through the toy catalog yesterday. <eos> there were many expensive toys. <eos> some of them were cool. <eos> i tried to decide which one to buy. <eos> i think i'll buy this one.
my mother hand made these trinkets to sell at the annual arts and crafts fair.  <eos> this particular piece took her 72 hours to make.  <eos> the train set she got help with from dad, as it requires some wood work.  <eos> dad is planning to take this along to the fair, while it is not hand made, he hopes that somebody will be interested.  <eos> my mom made this for my brother, she still has it, and is debating of to take it to the fair. 
the tomy catalog featured pages of wonderful toys such as these stuffed animals. <eos> there was also a dollhouse that any little girl would enjoy. <eos> for young boys, the model train set would be a great choice. <eos> the catalog also featured a few interesting toy robots. <eos> of course, there were also action figures which are always a popular choice.
today was the day. <eos> everyone was there. <eos> he came home. <eos> stayed at the airport. <eos> then we played in the snow.
just landed.  <eos> talking about new projects. <eos> went to dinner with friends. <eos> a surprise visitor joined them. <eos> passing food around.
we finally arrive after the long flight. <eos> i headed straight to my friends house where he was holding a small gathering. <eos> my friend poses for a picture while eating food. <eos> we later get to our hotel to check in. <eos> all of us head outside and enjoy the snow.

i recently took a trip through eastern europe. <eos> my geneology research lead me to the church my grandmother was baptized in. <eos> near the church is the cemetery where my ancestors are buried. <eos> while at their graves i reflected upon the difficult lives they had in that village. <eos> it was so emotional for me that i had to unwind at this nearby pub.
we took a vacation to europe this past winter <eos> we got to see all the sights  <eos> we went to the top of a hill <eos> you could see an old church.  <eos> there was no smoking in the church
when i was on vacation yesterday there was a lot of snow. <eos> the buildings were all very old and unique. <eos> i had a great time there. <eos> the town i stayed in was small. <eos> they were okay with smoking.
a perfect winter day to head out and see the town. <eos> a beautiful church along the way, looks so peaceful against the snow. <eos> there is something about snow that makes scenery so much more beautiful <eos> just take a look at that quiet, sleepy town. <eos> and a perfect way to wrap up our winter day, a drink at the local pub. 
the town didn't look like much when we arrived and with all the snow cover it was easy for me to get disappointed. <eos> as i entered the town however i was greeted by a large church at it's corner.  <eos> behind the church i found a lot of very detailed gravestones, the snow almost none existent on their tops.  <eos> as i left the graveyard i couldn't help but wonder what all of the people were like. <eos> to help forget some of the depressed things i had witnessed we all hit the local pub.

the bridal show was a big event this year. <eos> so many beautiful models walked the runway. <eos> some men did, too, modeling suits and tuxes. <eos> prom and other formal wear was also on display. <eos> even flower girls got in on the action. it was a great show!
the fashion show was a success. <eos> the women all looked beautiful. <eos> even the men looked great. <eos> this woman looked most stunning of all. <eos> the kids got in on the fun too.
here at a bridal show. how exciting.  <eos> this was my favorite wedding dress. <eos> this was my favorite suit, simple yet elegant. <eos> beautiful red dress but we're here for the little suit and tie. <eos> little girl was so cute. i had to get a picture of her.
i awoke to snow this morning.  <eos> franky my dog decided he wanted to take a run through it.  <eos> it wasn't very deep.  <eos> the playground next to my home looked so quiet and serene.  <eos> even the birds were chirping a little happier this morning. it's so beautiful when the snow falls. 
a snow storm arrived. <eos> the cars on the street had snow on them. <eos> the tree outside was covered with snow <eos> there were birds on the trees. <eos> the kids could not play in there swing set.
snow is so deep here its to my knees. <eos> max is loving the snow. <eos> aww how cute max left his foot prints. <eos> our playground is all frozen. <eos> me and max saw this beautiful bird today.
it was a snowy day. <eos> we had trouble driving because of the snow. <eos> but it looked beautiful upon the trees. <eos> and the birds even loved the snow <eos> it is a beautiful snow day.
we went for a walk in the show <eos> we saw a wolf <eos> we found paw prints <eos> the paw prints led us to a park <eos> we found a bird
a team is playing a game out in the rain. <eos> the two girls are watching the game with umbrellas over them. <eos> the city looms in the distance and they think they may like a tour. <eos> the old graveyard is very interesting and has many stones that are very old. <eos> finally, they end up at their friends house for a game after party.
the soccer game is in full swing. <eos> they couple poses for a quick shot. <eos> the river graces the backdrop. <eos> the city skyline is seen in the background. <eos> the large coniferous tree is looking healthy.
today we were going to be playing a friendly game of soccer.  <eos> however, as excited as we were, it decided to rain.  <eos> the skyline was not reassuring that the rain would subside either.  <eos> as we started the walk home, we passed by the cemetery where our grandmother was buried.  <eos> we were so glad to see our house, we were hoping not to get wet. 
today we headed out to watch a soccer game. <eos> it was a rainy day but that didn't stop us! <eos> look at that beautiful view of the city with the clouds over it. <eos> after the soccer game we took a walk around the quaint neighborhood and came across this sleepy little cemetery. <eos> it was near by this beautiful old house that looks like it was one of the first built in the area.
the kids were playing on the field <eos> and smiling. <eos> the city was big <eos> and the cemetery was vast <eos> near the large house.
we saw a lot of busy streets on our trip to the philippines. <eos> the fish market was bustling. <eos> there were many different types of fish to choose from. <eos> the customers deliberated to get the best deal. <eos> this little boy is not used to seeing tourists pass by.
i had a lot of work to do today. <eos> there were many customers. <eos> i had to see all of them. <eos> they also made me cut up seafood. <eos> it was dirty work.
the seafood market is a very popular place to china. <eos> they have mountains of seafood. <eos> the fish are all fresh and caught that day. <eos> many people come for miles around to get the fresh seafood. <eos> outside, children are usually wandering around the food stalls eating sweets.
visiting a local flea market for the fish. <eos> see all the many types of noodles they have. i'm in heaven.  <eos> i'll pass on the fish, it doesn't look very good today plus i prefer a nice lobster. <eos> trying to sell some fish to the locals, telling them how fresh it is. <eos> this was a cute little boy who wanted to help me find a seat.
it was fun going to the market that day. <eos> watching her make the noodles was very interesting. <eos> the place smelled like fish though. <eos> we were trying to decide how much we wanted to buy for dinner. <eos> even the son got a toy out of the trip.
when the guys get together, they like to drink. <eos> everyone sits around the family room playing their own games. <eos> dad is really involved in this racing game. <eos> after sitting inside for a while, we decided to go out to get some fresh air. <eos> we played a good old fashioned game of catch.
at kenny's party, lots of folks hung out in the back yard playing catch. <eos> they all enjoyed getting outside for some football. <eos> some people mostly liked throwing the ball. <eos> other people mostly liked catching. <eos> everyone had fun, even people who decided to sit a round out.
the brothers took a picture together.  <eos> he watched tv as the kids played on their laptops.  <eos> he was into the scary movie.  <eos> they went outside to play football.  <eos> oh no, the football was thrown too high. 
the man and his brother had a great time on the holiday. <eos> they spent lots of time playing together. <eos> they played video games. <eos> they even went outside. <eos> they played football together.
my best buddy larry is such a goofball. <eos> we are always fooling around, playing video games and being silly. <eos> i usually beat him. he's no good at video games. <eos> but when we go outside for football, he beats me. <eos> either way, we have a great time together.
two women sit at a restaurant table and eat their dinner. <eos> they walk through the restaurant and see statues standing in a corner. <eos> the beach is next and they take a bike ride. <eos> the coast of the beach has gorgeous mountains and trees. <eos> the two women pose by the ocean for a final picture.
it was a beautiful spring morning in may, not so long ago. <eos> martha and louis, who had been friends forever, decided to spend the day at the beach.  <eos> they walked along the path by the shore, greeting the people they met along the way.  <eos> then, they walked along the shoreline until they came to the lighthouse.  <eos> it was a long and lovely day which they finished by watching the sunset together from the shore. 
i took the kids to the coast for some sightseeing after lunch. <eos> these statues were taller than us! <eos> we rode bikes along the beach. <eos> we also saw this beautiful lighthouse. <eos> i had to get a photo with the path and lighthouse in the background.
family and old friends got together for a trip by the coast. <eos> the daughter is still not as tall as she wishes she was. <eos> there is a bike path you can take for miles by the ocean. <eos> it is very introspective to watch the waves slowly crash into the shore. <eos> day trips with nature always help families bond.
this was the sunset from our first morning on vacation <eos> john and i posing for our pictures with the lighthouse in the background <eos> this is me bike rdiing along the ocean............ what beautiful scenery <eos> i love this photo from vacation <eos> i took this picture of the sunset our last morning on vacation

i finally got my hands on the newest game to hit the market and it's complete with realistic looking vending machines. <eos> after walking around the area a bit i also ran into a realistic looking statue in the center of the room. <eos> if your into makeup and advertising there is no need to worry because this game has that too. <eos> an outside look at the shopping mall from the parking lot. <eos> another store complete with a full size display and various clothes. 
the new computer technologies had allowed us to make significant strides in signs. <eos> and, other types of designs or logos. <eos> i even learned to make abstract images.. <eos> like, this colorful puzzle. <eos> i finished my education with buildings.
you can explore a whole new world as a new character in video games. <eos> you can shop for accessories for your online avatar. <eos> you can send your online persona out into the world and play games. <eos> you can explore a world where the laws of physics sometimes work a little different. <eos> you can experience different seasons in just a few minutes.
i learned how to play a new game. my character was barber yumyum. <eos> the game was like being on an lsd trip. <eos> there was a strange spaceship looking thing. <eos> and puzzle pieces i wasn't sure what to do with. <eos> you also could build things.
today was the day. <eos> everyone was there. <eos> it was packed. <eos> then came the speech. <eos> and then the awards.
i got to the ceremony and there was already people there. <eos> they served food there. <eos> the speakers had a lot of speeches prepared. <eos> there were many of them. <eos> they talked for hours.
the group gathered together to celebrate a wonderful man today.. <eos> colleagues from all over the country came to sit with him and converse. <eos> it appeared over 50 educated lecturers had came to the award ceremony. <eos> and, finally, the dean took the podium. <eos> he presented mr. ward with his award and they celebrated his accomplishment.
there was an event today for the elders. <eos> everyone was having a great time talking and communicating. <eos> there was a even a man on stage to give a speech. <eos> a woman also had something she wanted to say to the crowd. <eos> overall, there were three people giving speeches and each of them were important.
the father was happy <eos> that they were coming to eat with him. <eos> everyone sat down <eos> to hear the guy talk <eos> before he left the event.
the old train station has been meticulously restored.  <eos> the old engine is as pristine as it was when it was new. <eos> the crew puts a lot of work into keeping things in top order. <eos> the green engine looks good pulling the three red cars.  <eos> no train station would be complete without it's mascot.
the boys like the steam engine. <eos> the green looks fresh. <eos> it still works well. <eos> they let people still ride. <eos> we will take the boys soon.
today we went to the train museum. <eos> there was a train named edward thomas. <eos> it was green and red. <eos> it looked very nostalgic and reminded me of my childhood. <eos> the kids and i had a lot of fun.
i went to the train station yesterday. <eos> when my train showed up we got on. <eos> it was going to be a long ride. <eos> the train was not very long. <eos> i brought my dog with me.
i decided my dog would like a train ride. off to the train station we go. <eos> this is the train we will be taking our short trip on. <eos> my friend is the conductor. he is getting ready to attach the cars. <eos> here is the train all together. <eos> as you can see, my dog had a fantastic time.
i went to the beach last christmas. <eos> there was no snow on the roads. <eos> when i got to the beach there were some flowers three. <eos> i picked them up and took them with me. <eos> i had a great time.
there is beauty in an old town in winter. <eos> the snow begins to melt, and the seagulls come out to bathe. <eos> if you look closely, you might find sharks teeth intermixed with the shells on the water's edge.  <eos> some of the headstones have aged and gained new aesthetic appeal. <eos> this gravestone, with leaves carefully placed, makes for a wonderful photograph.
history is important to everyone. <eos> it tells us where we came from and how we got where we are. <eos> graves are sad, <eos> but they remind us of those once loved. <eos> their lives may have been short, but their significance cannot be measured.
the road was clear of snow <eos> near the water. <eos> there was a man kneeling <eos> near the grave <eos> of someone that he knew.
we went for a walk down my street <eos> we found an ocean <eos> there was a lady praying  <eos> she was at a grave by the water <eos> someone else was buried near by as well
sally was taking some budoir photos for her boyfriend. <eos> he was fighting oversees and she wanted to look her best. <eos> she enjoyed posing and smiling for the camera. <eos> she knew the photos would get passed around the barracks, but as long as he was happy she didn't care. <eos> she just wanted him to remember her while he was gone. 
the model was super cute, she loved showing off her body. <eos> she lied on the bed very innocently. <eos> she continued showing off her body at all angles.  <eos> a nice view from the back. <eos> she finally goes topless.
the girl posed for some boudior shots. <eos> she dressed in lingerie. <eos> she planned on giving the photos to her husband for his birthday. <eos> the photographer did a great job. <eos> they were risque but tasteful.
she wanted to make her husband a calendar for his birthday and she started off with sexy plaid. <eos> she then wanted to play the devil.. <eos> and, show that she would get more and more risquãƒâ©. <eos> she showed her nice buttocks, which is his favorite feature on her. <eos> and, finished with a beautiful frontal.
i'd like my wife to break into underwear modeling, so i took some shots of her. <eos> i think she's as pretty as anyone i've seen in catalogs. <eos> she has gorgeous hair, and she looks great in fancy clothes. <eos> it was fun taking the pictures! <eos> i hope she gets a big contract soon. it will be fun for her, and would certainly help the budget!
we decided to take a walk around town to see all the local stores. <eos> we started bright and early in the morning, it was such a beautiful day. <eos> we stopped for lunch at the bar cafe and had a wonderful sandwhich. <eos> we then went to copperfield's books and read and browsed for awhile. <eos> finally,on our way back we stopped in to popeyes for some delicious fried chicken.
the friends tour the town and all of the attractions it hold. <eos> there is a large shadow cast on the ground from one of the friends. <eos> a book store named copperfield's is in the center of town. <eos> the store has many great books that can be purchased if you wish to do so. <eos> the street is empty with not many cars or people.
they took an evening stroll to visit the downtown area of the irish city <eos> the beautiful windows and buildings afforded them a lovely scene. <eos> they stopped at the cafãƒâ© and had a cup of coffee.. <eos> and, then went to the bookstore for some old irish books.. <eos> and, finished the day at the local karaoke bar..
i went to the bookstore yesterday. <eos> it was a long walk. <eos> they have a great selection there. <eos> there were a ton of books on display. <eos> afterward i was hungry so i left to grab something to eat.
it was a charming old store.  <eos> an old man was sitting outside the entrance.  <eos> books were her great escape.  <eos> she was a regular, stopping by weekly.  <eos> today there wasn't much traffic which was good for her since she had walked. 
the epa was out protesting against contaminated water. <eos> the protest took place in front of their headquarters. <eos> this shows one of the banners they put up. <eos> they drew quite a crowd. <eos> other protesters walked the streets. i hope it made a difference.
i flew to appalachia in march.  <eos> there was an epa protest that i wanted to attend.  <eos> it had to do with water contamination.  <eos> the turn out was pretty good.  <eos> this guy was still there when i was leaving. 
the protest occurred in front of the building.  <eos> we set up tents in front of the epa building.  <eos> we wanted people to be aware of our cause.  <eos> a passerby asked us what our goals were.  <eos> supporters came out to protest with us.
the building was large <eos> and had a big sign. <eos> there was an event for water <eos> that many people attended <eos> and all had a good time protesting.
the environmental protection agency (epa) opened its doors to an annual conference that would educate the public on global issues.  <eos> any passerby would be greeted with a sign that showcased that this was indeed the epa's headquarters. <eos> a large sign, stationed outside warned of the problem with water contamination. <eos> it wasn't long before camera crews began to show up, hoping to get a new story. <eos> there were also protestors who arrived, believing that the epa was not doing enough for the community.
we all went hiking in the woods together. <eos> in the trunk of a tree, my friend drew a face. <eos> there were some rocks planted in the soil. <eos> there was also a yellow fungus growing on the outside of the tree. <eos> one of the women drank water because she was thirsty.
we went on a hike yesterday. <eos> there were a lot of strange plants there. <eos> i had a great time. <eos> we drank a lot of water while we were hiking. <eos> the view was spectacular.
family goes out for a camping trip and <eos> then they see trees carved with different kind of stuff and <eos> bird eggs laying around , and also <eos> some type of orange splat of liquid and then <eos> they take a break and drink some water
my family and i went for a hike this weekend.  <eos> there was a fallen tree which we carved a mans face in.  <eos> everything, right down to the rocks seemed beautiful.  <eos> other things were gross like this thing growing on a tree stump.  <eos> by the end i was exhausted and ready to go home. 
our group before heading out to look for mushrooms. <eos> someone made a very creative face with this log end. <eos> some non edible but neat looking mushrooms. <eos> the scrambled egg mushroom, aptly named. <eos> jean taking a long drink after a few hours of foraging.
they were experimenting with their coffee formula at the shop. <eos> first, they calibrated the machines. <eos> they then decided what flavor to make. <eos> they filtered the mixture. <eos> once it was filtered, they tasted and tested until it was just right. 
decided to take a day trip out with the family. <eos> came across a coffee factory and we got to take a tour and see how everything works. <eos> they have some really complicated looking machines that help with the process. <eos> there are buttons and levers everywhere.  <eos> we even got to step in and help with the process!
they arrived at the modern restaurant and ready to learn. <eos> they were fascinated by all the machinery... <eos> especially, the fancy set of blenders. <eos> and, then he started to make his cup of coffee. <eos> which, turned out to be a failure this time.
i work at a coffee shop.  <eos> we have a lot of big equipment that makes the coffee.  <eos> the coffee is really good.  <eos> each cup is made with care.  <eos> even the grounds left behind are used. 
the building had a big sign <eos> and equipment inside. <eos> there were coffee makers <eos> that the man used <eos> to make fresh coffee.
the trail lead through the park. <eos> they enjoyed looking up at the tree tops. <eos> there were planters along the way. <eos> it ended at the lake. <eos> there was an old tree growing from the bottom of the lake but it didn't look healthy.
we decided to take a walk outdoors on a fine fall day. <eos> the paths were clear and the landscape was lush. <eos> the railroad tracks always provide a good background. <eos> the water was bustling by under the bridge. <eos> finally, we reached downtown and stopped for a bite to eat. 
they wandered the golf course... <eos> and, took in the beautiful scenery.. <eos> especially the rotunda near the 16th hole... <eos> after the round of golf, they headed for the pond. <eos> where they sat by the shore for hours.
my favorite time of the year is when the leaves begin to turn colors. <eos> it's a perfect time to take a walk outside and enjoy nature. <eos> during my walk, i decided to follow the local railroad tracks. <eos> i eventually made my way to the old bridge in town. <eos> at the end of my nature walk, i went into the city for lunch. 
we decided to get our of the city for a little while and visit the countryside. <eos> the day was beautiful. <eos> we visited a park. <eos> the river ran next to the park. <eos> the sound of the water was very peaceful. 
there were a lot of people at the convention. <eos> they were all there to listen to the speaker. <eos> she had prepared a great speech. <eos> everyone had questions. <eos> she was up there for a couple of hours.
hellen loved to give speeches but she was losing her touch. <eos> she felt like she didn't know what she was doing in front of so many people anymore. <eos> the questions she was getting asked were more about her hair and makeup. <eos> she wanted to talk about important topics and now hair. <eos> she finally decided that her next speech would be about feminism. 
jan presented her experience running a retail store this morning to business students. <eos> she started off with personal experiences. <eos> she opened up the discussion to the students. <eos> one of the questioners was a former employee that was let go. <eos> it made jan realize what a small world it truly is.
today i had to teach our new direction <eos> i used plenty of great examples and layouts <eos> then stopped to answer some questions <eos> i then continued one more presentation <eos> and i winded down the evening with a photo session
she put on her black leather jacket for the her lecture because it matched her mood.  <eos> the message was important but with everything in the back of her mind she was worried about her delivery.  <eos> being there, being present in her mind just wasn't happening that day.  <eos> she kept wondering if her audience knew.  <eos> pushing the thoughts out of her mind, she persevered. 
new product line our stores will be carrying.today is an exhibition and discussion of features and suggested retail pricing. <eos> each region representative got to examine and photograph the merchandise. <eos> this i think was my favorite line.big fan of earthy tones and brown's.don't know how i don't spend my whole paycheck working in this place. <eos> this was the most popular line with the ladies.a lot had to deal with the color choices. <eos> marina choose the previous picture line of merchandise to do her presentation on.i honestly think it was her favorite.

i needed to get a good picture of the school principle for the paper. <eos> i didn't like the angle of this shot. <eos> the color on this one was too yellow. <eos> i feel this one is too far away. <eos> i finally chose this one as i feel it is my best shot.

the president of our company held a banquet for the employees. <eos> he spoke for a long time. <eos> his speech was so boring, i wondered why i came in the first place. <eos> then i remembered i came for the free food. <eos> at least i could eat while he talked.
the man was speechless <eos> and did not know what to say. <eos> then he started talking again <eos> and was happy <eos> at the response that he got.
we witnessed the most amazing landscapes and mountain ranges we have ever seen! <eos> the way the mountain reflected in the lake was mesmerizing! <eos> we loved the design of the little town in the mountains! <eos> the magnificent castle was high upon the mountain! <eos> the gorgeous mountain peak was breathtaking!
i stayed at a castle when i was on vacation last week. <eos> the lake was beautiful. <eos> the castle resort was huge. <eos> i couldn't understand the language so it made the signs hard to read. <eos> afterward i bought a blanket.
so this is where all the beautiful landscape screenshots come from! <eos> is this a place to live forever, or what? <eos> oh, my gosh, just build me a tiny house and i'm all here! <eos> and castles - they have castles, too! <eos> what an impressive mountain!

moving to alaska was a huge decision. my family and i decided to go before we ever saw the raw beauty.  <eos> the mountains and oceans merge together from all spots in cordova, alaska.  <eos> we moved there last year to pastor a small church that is smack dab in the middle of the wilderness. <eos> we even discovered a hidden castle behind a small mountain that was built many years ago.  <eos> no matter where i stand, i find the majesty of alaska. there are snow covered mountains and crystal blue oceans in all directions.

cycling is very popular in our city. <eos> people ride for recreation and transportation. <eos> sometimes you see more bikes than cars on the roads. <eos> many people commute daily on their bicycles. <eos> people here certainly love cycling.
the bicycle park at the train station can be very busy indeed.  <eos> sometimes bicycle commuters have to wait while getting to their lock up.  <eos> pondering options, which direction to go, this man is ready for his commute on the train.  <eos> another pensive train station bicyclist on the move, hoping she'll be on time.  <eos> not everything is all business at the train station. sometimes commuters have a chance for a hug! 
rachel loves to ride her bike.  <eos> so does jacob. he rides several times a day.  <eos> they both steal bikes from all over town and pile them up here.  <eos> along comes mr. ryobi and he counts the bikes and has them picked up to ship to the bike factory to be repainted.  <eos> here's two bikes that are about to get stolen. they'll be mad but rachel and jacob have to make their money. 
she met him when she was out for a ride.  <eos> they hit it off immediately.  <eos> they would park their bikes and take the train.  <eos> most of her friends rode bike to the station and mr. bentley was no exception.  <eos> when he saw them kissing, she was quite embarrassed and she didn't know why.
everyone's bike was set up for the journey. <eos> there were so many lanes to overcome before moving onto a clear land. <eos> keith didn't look excited, but more focused. <eos> my wife was very patient since she doesn't have much experience riding bikes. <eos> i couldn't recall a part of the journey involving a public display of affection.
